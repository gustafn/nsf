<- handle change in tcl 8.5.8: http://tcl.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/tcl/tcl/generic/tclObj.c?sortby=date&r1=1.139.2.1&r2=1.139.2.2&pathrev=core-8-5-branch
  in xotcl:
   * when e.g. the parent namespace is deleted with a "namespace delete", the change
     above causes, the no xotcl methods could be resolved (and called) anymore.
  * therefore, e.g. a "C dealloc c1" did not work, since dealloc passes
    c1 via tcl_obj, and the tcl_obj is as well converted to an xotcl object via
    Tcl_GetCommandFromObj(), which fails as well.
- to bypass this problem, xotcl has now a C-function DoDealloc(), which
   is called, when this situation is detected.
- some more cases, where xotcl could reference already freed memory
   were fixed (thanks to enable-symbols=mem)
- as collateral damage, parts of the regression test don't work currently


- added refcounting in ObjectDispatch() to make sure, obj survives until
   the end of the function

- added existence test for slot extractor (needed for 8.5.8)
- added refcounting CallStackDoDestroy() to ensure existence of
   object until end of function
- make sure to call PrimitiveDestroy() before DeleteCommandFromToken(),
       otherwise e.g. unset traces on this object cannot be executed
- regression test works again

- get rid of rst->deallocCalled (not needed due to reference counting
   on xotcl objects)
- reduce verbosity

- reactivated XOTclErrInProc()

- renamed "ClassName info instmixinof ?-closure? ?pattern?" into
  "ClassName info class-mixin-of ?-closure? ?pattern?"
- renamed "ClassName info mixinof ?-closure? ?pattern?" into
  "ClassName info object-mixin-of ?-closure? ?pattern?"
- added emulation "ClassName info instmixinof|mixinof" for xotcl1

- update to TEA 3.7 (from TEA 3.5)
- use of INT2PTR to avoid warnings about different sizes on 64bit
   architectures
- defined HAVE_INTPTR_T as a macro to make definition of INT2PTR working

- use INT2PTR and PTR2INT macros in generated stubs

- handle HAVE_UINTPTR_T like HAVE_INTPTR_T
- use ::xotcl::setinstvar instead of ::xotcl::setinstvar in serializer

- change and rename cmd instvar
    ::xotcl::instvar -object someObject newVar
   into
     ::xotcl::importvar someObject newVar
   Rationale of change:
      only needed in xotcl2 for importing variables
      from different objects

- changed assertions:
   old (xotcl1) interface: 3 methods + 3 info methods
      * <object> check Options
      * <object> info check
      * <object> invar Conditions
      * <object> info invar
      * <class> instinvar Conditions
      * <class> info instinvar

   new (xotcl2) interface: 1 cmd (similar to ::xotcl::relation)
      ::xotcl::assertion check|object-invar|class-invar ?arg?
- added emulation for xotcl1

- deleted name-specific C macros:
    isInfoString, isInstinvarString, isInvarString, isInstprocString, isProcString

- made some more xotcl2 methods protected
  (no big need to call these from different objects):
  unknown, uplevel, upvar

- added ::xotcl::exists as cmd

- added ::xotcl::method as cmd instead of methods object-method and
  class-method

- added ::xotcl::forward as cmd instead of method
   now, all method-defining-methods (alias, method, forward, setter)
   are defined as cmds (this should make life of serializer easier)

- moved "-per-object" consequently immediately after obj in the
  following commands
     : ::xotcl::alias, ::xotcl::methodproperty, ::xotcl::setter
  to achieve conformance with ::xotcl::forward and ::xotcl::method


-per-object
nach methodName:
vor methodName: alias forward method methodproperty setter


- added experimental flag for alias "-noleaf" to force a stack frame
   to be written (e.g. necessary for "next"). makes only sense for
   aliases to c-implemented cmds

- fix inconsistent behaviour of dotVarResolver
    "o eval {set .x 1}" was setting var ".x" instead of "x"
  The problem was due to a interaction between
  the namespace varResolver() and the DotVarResolver()

- fix for DotCmdResolver during compilation of a proc by Tcl.
- extended regression text
- found 2 potential bugs (not fixed yet)

- fix eval method with requirenamespace

- removed dependency on proc/instproc in copy/move.
   code is now independent of class system

- changed results of "filtersearch" and "self next" to new naming
   Caveat: for xotcl1, there is no mapping for the names to the
   old style in "self next" and "self filterreg"
- backwards compatible mapping of filtersearch in xotcl1

- removed XOTclInstVar from the C-level API.
   still todo add all xotcl*cmds to C api, including importvar

- removed all unreferenced entries from XOTE_*
- regrouped XOTE_* for easier comprehension
- used XOTE_* on more occasions
- used XOTclCallCommand() for calling Tcl
   "format" and "interp"

- added option "arg=.." to parameter options; this argument
   can be passed to converter; used currently for "type=relation"
   to flag, that the relation type is different from the parameter
   name
- extended "objectparameter" to handle such cases
- removed relationtypes "mixin", "filter", "instfilter" and
  "instmixin" since not needed due to converterArg

- xotcl.c: removed all names starting with "inst"
   (exception: instvar)

- added option "-application" to "info callable" to
   omit methods from base classes
- extended regression test
- changed naming of methodtype "system" to "builtin"
- added "info methods" to migration guide

- added "info method" to migration guide

- modernize test a little: all local definitions of proc "?" are gone.
- added interface to test: "Test parameter count SOMEVALUE" to
   specify conveniently e.g. the number of tests the be executed
- add XOTCL_CM_NO_UNKNOWN to dispatch of defaultmethod

- added option "objectsystems" to ::xotcl::configure to
   obtain the currently defined object systems
- added option "baseclass" to ::xotcl::is to check, whether
   a class is a baseclass of an object system
   (root class or root meta-class of object system)
- changed result of "... info methods -methodtype scripted"
   to return only truly scripted methods (no aliases)
- some more cleanup in regression tests
- first version of serializer for xotcl1 + xotcl2

- serializer: move checking of the requested objects
   to be exported to the invocation of "Serializer all"
- replace "namespace import ::xotcl::*" by "xotcl::use xotcl1"

- make allocation sizes for dynamically allocated parameterContexts
   consistent between alloc and realloc
- added sanity check in getAllClassMixinsOf()
   It seems as it would be possible with __defaultSupeclass to define
   a class which has itself als a subclass. Just a quick
   fix, we have investigate more on this.

- improved naming of resolvers: use InterpDot*Resolver and
  NsDot*Resolver for interp wide and namespace specific resolvers
- added possibility to escape the call of commands starting
   with a dot from method bodies by prefixing with a second dot.

- make sure to have an xotcl frame pushed, when byte-code-compiler
   is invoked. This is necessary for providing the context for
   dotCmd resolvers

- use uplevel in slot add/delete to evaluate in calling namespace
   (for not fully qualified object names)
- determine namespace in test method "?" to allow its execution
   in an "namespace eval"
- added regression tests


- NsDotVarResolver: don't create variables on CMETHOD frames
   when their names do not start with a "."

- general overhaul of XOTcl_PushFrame()XOTcl_PopFrame():
   new functions:
     * XOTcl_PushFrameCsc()/XOTcl_PopFrameCsc(): for CMETHOD fames
     * XOTcl_PushFrameObj()/XOTcl_PopFrameObj(): for OBJECT frames
       (objscope)

- preallocate obj->vartable in XOTcl_PushFrameObj() to
   avoid situations where to non-existing vartable is created
   on demand at different places (e.g. on stack and in
   var resolver)

- caller of convertToRelationtype(): make sure that last argument
   keeping the result is large enough to held pointer (in case of
   sizeof(void) != sizeof(int)

- Serializer: include ObjectSystemSerializer in "Serializer all"
- Serializer: use class-mixin in dependency order
- Serializer: add appropriate "::xotcl::use xotcl1|xotcl2"
- Serializer: fix syntax in exportMethods
- Serializer: provide limited support for exporting aliases for xotcl1 objects

- add calltype to tcl85showStack

- keep orignial objc/objc in call stack context such that
   next/self args works with canonical args (allow e.g.
   different order of nonpos args in a next)
- make naming in xotcl.c more consistent
- ensure to return empty, when "info callable -which" fails
- extend regression test

- exithandler is different in xotcl2 -> comment, check OpenACS
- ensure relation filter/instfilter etc. mit guards

- extended migration guide
- defined eval in predefined via "-nonleaf", used at various places
- added "info mixinof ?-scope all|object|class? ?pattern?", dropped
   "object-mixin-of" and "class-mixin-on" from registered method
- extended regression test
- xotcl1: make "-volatile" invoked via unknown behave correctly

- provide minimal xotcl2 compatibility
- added non positional parameter "type" to "get_parameter"
- removed "required" from parameters, which is in XOTcl 1 just a comment
- minor cleanup

- experimental change of resolver name prefix char from dot to single colon

- making methodDefinitions NULL terminated
- passing optional arg to user-defined argument converter
- refuse to redefine type converters for a single parameter
- adding regression test for parameters

    - added instance variable arg for interfacing with parameter
      interface. "arg" acts like a clientdata for type converter
    - added multiple parameter options handling to method "parameter"
       to obtain similar functionality from object parameters
       as from method parameters
    - added convenience method "??" to test to indicated test
      that should fail with an error
    - added severity type converters to achieve same
       object type checking as in ::xotcl::is
       (these are currently in the regression test, should move
       finally into predefined.xotcl)
    - extended regression test

- new function ::xotcl::parameterFromSlot (used in argument checker as  well)
- use ::xotcl::forward in Slot constructor (instead of dispatch)
- checking methods on slots for single- and multivalued slots
   (can be optimized)
- extended regression test

- don't run multiple queries in "??"
- fixed last changes to regression test as usual

- added "multivalued" to parameter options
- made error message produced by XOTclObjErrType look like Tcl's error
   messages
- extended regression test
- test utility: changed "?" to return error msg in case of error

- checking multivalued types in "-parameters" by using argument
  checker
- some cleanup
- extend regression test

valuecheck.001:	  5.27 mms, ::xotcl::valuecheck object o1
valuecheck.002: ::xotcl::valuecheck object 1 ok
valuecheck.003:	  3.06 mms, ::xotcl::is o1 object

- new cmd "::xotcl::valuecheck <valueConstraints> <value>"
  where "valueConstraints" is whatever is allowed in e.g. parameters
  (including user defined types)
- new Tcl_ObjType "xotclParam"

- parameterFromSlot returns now pair object-param & method-param
- define disallowed parameter options for object parameter, method
  parameter and value-check command
- make canonical table of parameter options (currently in
  tests/parameter.xotcl)
- extend regression test
- systematic checking, what value constraints should be allowed/not
   allowed in valuecheck

- pass arg from objectparameter as first argument to objparms
   (similiar to client data)

- support for parameter spec of form "type=XXX" to denote that
   the parameter must be an object of the specified type (class;
   directly or indirectly)
- new built-in converter: convertToObjectOfType()
- keep parameterObj (source for conversion to XOTclParam)
   for making introspection less work. However, this is
   only used for XOTclParams generated via ParamParse().
- extending regression test

- name XOTclObjects always "object" instead of "obj" to avoid
   potential confusion with Tcl_Objs

- remove unneeded push and pop operations in ListChildren() and
   ObjectHasChildren()

- allow syntax "object,type=::SomeClass" and "class,type=::SomeMetaClass"
   (currently identical, we should as well check for class/meta-class
   in case of "class,type=SomeClass")

- define everything concerning basic slot setup in a single
   "namespace eval ::xotcl {...}"
- undefine ::xotcl::createBootstrapAttributeSlots after this block
- fix default DefaultSuperClass() with isMeta==1 in cases,
   where we are already at the root meta class
- use "-parameter" in xotcl1 instead of  createBootstrapAttributeSlots

- cleanup of legacy stuff in slot management.
   * merged InfoSlot and InterceptorSlot into RelationSlot
   * get rid of legacy "mixin set ...." command
- renamed "parameterSlot" into "methodParameterSlot" to avoid
   potential confusions

- refactor Slot class hierarchy
- new methods in ObjectParameterSlot "toParameterSyntax" and
  "createFromParameterSyntax"
- some more cleanup
- removed legacy syntax for "-parmeters"

- moved slot optimizer from ::xotcl::ObjectParameterSlot::Optimizer to
  ::xotcl::Attribute::Optimizer

- support for all string constraints provided by "string is ... $value"
  in object and method parameters ("alum", "alpha", ..., "xdigit").
  Technically, these types are tclobjs (using converter convertToTclobj)
  having pParm->converterArg set to the constraints.
- extended regression test

- get rid of convertToObjectOfType(), make convertToClass() and
  converterToObject() more general, accepting type constraints

- predefined.xotcl: move toParameterSyntax and objectparameter to
  a position, where basic slot definitions are provided
- fixed default value setting in bootstrap code
- provide more precise error message in converter,
  when object type are used
- extend regression test

- added error message when substdefault is specified without a default value
- extend regression test

- added parameter option slot= to pass slotobj to a certain parameter
- use slot option to keep relation between parameter and slot
- object parameter dispatch type checker on slot objects
- allow transformation via user-defined converter (can be use to
  standardize parameter values)
  experimental implementation, refcounting has to be looked
  in detail, maybe we need a different interface for the converters

- provide checker-methods for
   -> objectParameter
   -> methodParameter
- slotobject specific checker-methods

- treat currently unknown converters in valuecheckcmd as error
- fix the regression test from the last changes

- added argument for converter to return the converted tcl_obj, which
  should be passed on (currently only used for viaCmd); this way,
  we could remove the kludge of querying the converter after the conversion
  for special handling.

- handle multivalued + values converted viaCmd converter the new
  output list is only built when needed via ArgumentCheckHelper()

- fix counter initialization in ::xotcl::importvar
- register alternate "new" method in "contains" for xotcl2 and
  (if available) for xotcl1 objects

- provide error message for cases, where parameter options are not
  allowed (or ignored)

- move methodParameter checkers for "mixin", "baseclass" and "metaclass"
  to predefined.
- deactivated checkMethods in gentclAPI.decls and in xotcl.c

- renamed "::xotcl::is ... mixin ..." to "::xotcl::is ... hasmixin ..."
  (effects parametertypes as well)

- made error messages for failed conversions more consistent
  (note that tcl does not provide the parameter name in the error message,
  but user-defined converters do)

- fixed valuecheck in connection with modifying converters
- extended regression test

- fixed compilation for tcl 8.6b1

- Allowed parameter specification for setters.
  One can define now a setter with constraints like e.g.
     ::xotcl::setter o a:integer
  to define a setter named "a" for object "o" which
  has to be integer.
- Extended regression test
- Followed naming conventions for several structures

- setterCmd(): Do not allow methodNames start with "-"
- setterCmd(): Do not allow defaults for setters
- extend regression test

- removed duplicate error message in "hasmixin" converter
- fixed refcounting in converting user-types in case of errors
- extended regression test

- added a "-nocomplain" option to ::xotcl::valuecheck
- changed semantic of ::xotcl::valuecheck: per default,
  valuecheck raises an error or returns true.
  If "-nocomplain" is used, valuecheck returns
  0 or 1 like implemented befor this change
- extended regression test

- added parameter "incremental" to ::xotcl::Attribute:
  when set, one can use "object paramname add|delete $value" etc.
- use setters with parameter constraints in slot optimizer
- as a consequence, setting attributes via slot names is about
  twice as fast as before, when parameter constraints are used.
- extended regression test

- fixed returned method name when setter was used on objects
- reduce verbosity

- implemented "info method definition|parameter|args $name" for
  settercmds (with parameter constraints)
- extended regression test

- fixed result resetting for user defined converters

- ::xotcl::valuecheck: moved "-nocomplain" to first position
  (similar to e.g. unset)

- experimental: allow to shadow built-in types provided that
  a) slot= is specified explicitly, and
  b) the specified slot is not the default slot.
  This should guarantee that we do not interfere with
  the predefined converters for the c-level interface.
- incremented ref count on results of all-level converter
- extended regression test

- new methods for MetaSlot to factor out common code:
   + slotName (to ease name-construction, care about
     slot container)
   + createFromParameterSyntax: essentially move from
     ::xotcl::Attribute to the meta class
- test environment: make sure to avoid confusions between
  the "namespace" method and command

- added a version of the "attribute" method to predefined

- removed the following classes and methods
     ::xotcl::Attribute->check_single_value
     ::xotcl::Attribute->check_multiple_values
     ::xotcl::Attribute->mk_type_checker
     class ::xotcl::Attribute::Nocheck

- centralize fetching of tcl-obj-types in xotcl_init

- support for method modifier "object", "protected" and "public"
  for method "attribute". One can use now e.g.

     Class create C {
       :attribute a
       :public attribute b
       :protected attribute c

       :object attribute A
       :public object attribute B
       :protected object attribute C
    }

  "protected" and "public" refers to the registered accessor functions

- experimental checking function ::xotcl::is2 implemented, which generalizes
  between ::xotcl::is and ::xotcl::valuecheck (it is a valuecheck -nocomplain
  with an ::xotcl::is syntax and switched arguments)

- Unified on c-level "info class-mixin-of" and "info object-mixin-of"
  to "info mixinof ?-scope all|object|class? ?-closure? ?pattern?
  The former "info class-mixin-of"
  is now "info mixinof -scope class"
- adapted xotcl1 layer for this change
- extended experimental ::xotcl::is2 to handle flags -type and -hasmixin
    ::xotcl::is2 <obj> object ?-type <type>? ?-hasmixin <class>?

- renamed old "xotcl::is" -> "xotcl::objectproperty"
- renamed old "xotcl::is2" -> "xotcl::is"
- we have now is tests for objects in ::xotcl::objectproperty
    ::xotcl::objectproperty $obj object
    ::xotcl::objectproperty $obj class
    ::xotcl::objectproperty $obj baseclass
    ::xotcl::objectproperty $obj metaclass
    ::xotcl::objectproperty $obj type XXXX
    ::xotcl::objectproperty $obj hasmixin XXXX

- "::xotcl::is" is the higher level command,
  supporting string constraints "e.g. upper", user defined type checkers
  and as well object properties (every parameter type supported for object
  and method parameter). Examples:
    ::xotcl::is $obj object ?-type $type? ?-hasmixin $mixin?
    ::xotcl::is $cl class ?-type $type? ?-hasmixin $mixin?
    ::xotcl::is obj metaclass
    ::xotcl::is $num integer
    ::xotcl::is $string upper

- implemented 2nd level reference counting for paramObjType

- defined "info is" as alias of "::xotcl::objectproperty"

- renamed ::xotcl::valuecheck -> ::xotcl::parametercheck
- replaced in predefined occurrences of ::xotcl::is by ::xotcl::objectproperty

- fixed namespace handling on stack for objects with namespaces
  (before, it was possible that a variable was created in
  an object's namespace without -objscope)
- as a consequence, ListChildren() had to be adjusted, since
  it depended on the previous namespace handling on the stack
- fixed object resolving in NsDotVarResolver()
  (before, it was possible that NsDotVarResolver could
  create variables in the wrong namespace)
- simplified NsDotVarResolver()
- more cleanup in name resolver
    * USE_DOT is gone
    * XOTclDotDotCmd() removed
    * improved performance of InterpCompiledDotVarResolver()
    * made LookupVarFromTable() obsolete and removed it
    * renamed DotVarResolver() and friends to ColonVarResolver() etc.
- extended regression test

- call XOTclObject always "object" instead of "obj"

- initcmd: use for initcmds CMETHOD frames instead of OBJECT stack frames
- initcmd: skip parent-stack frame's objscope for initcmd
- changed hash-based lookup of children into a cmd-based lookup
- extended regression test

- cleanup in stack handlers (naming, arguments)

- XOTclCallStackFindLastInvocation(): return last scripted invocation
- use xotcl1 in webserver test to make rull regression test working
- make xotcl::use silent

- added option "-nonleaf" for method alias
- added introspection (for "info method definition") for "alias ... -nonleaf ..."

- removed obsolete ::xotcl::configure option "cacheinterface"

- removed XOTclCreateClass() and XOTclDeleteClass();
  both are identical with XOTclCreateObject() and XOTclDeleteObject()

- renaming of instance variable specific primitiva for more
  consistency with ::xotcl::importvar:

    ::xotcl::exists -> ::xotcl::existsvar
    ::xotcl::setinstvar -> ::xotcl::setvar

- requireNameSpace:
   * fix potential crash in requireNameSpace in objscoped methods
     by swapping all vartable references in objscopes on stack
     to the vartable in the namespace, when it is created
- extending regression test

- working towards KEEP_VARS_IN_CMETHOD_FRAME

- enable compilation with assertion turned on (via NDEBUG)
- fix potentially uninitialized flags for ArgumentCheck()
- some further cleanup, tested with 32 bit under Mac OS X 10.6

- removed obsolete generic/xotclAppInit.c
- changed loading method in xotclsh from Xotcl_Init() to Tcl_PkgRequire()

- updating tcl.m4 to the actual version (TEA 3.7)
- minor cleanup (varresolution test and comment)

- defined "xotcl::current" as synonym for "::xotcl::self"
- new options for ::xotcl::current
   current object == current
   current method == current proc
   current callingmethod == current callingproc
- "self proc" and friends are for backward compatibility for xotcl1,
  "current method" and friends are for xotcl2
- namespace exported "::xotcl::current"

- use "::xotcl::current" instead of "xotcl::self" in predefined

- use "CONST char *" in generated interface and below
- further cleanup using "CONST char *"

- remove dependency from xotcl1 in handling of forwarders in method "copy"
- further cleanup using "CONST char *", improving on naming conventions

- added an experimental "info frame" handler, which appends "object" and
  "class" pairs

- fixed wrong name for per-object filter in RelationSlot
- fixed condition in filter-invocation to top-level frames
- added frametype to information returned by "info frame"
- change frametype in "info frame" form bit-pattern to symbolic names
- use a more recent version of unix/tclAppInit.c
- fix syntax in predefined
- let serializer call "init" of attributes, even if it is protected

- fixing "-parameter" with empty content
- more variable naming cleanup
- fix line breaking in serializer for "exportedObjects"

- call c-implemented methods directly, when this is safe
  (implemented for XOTE_ALLOC, XOTE_CLEANUP, XOTE_CONFIGURE,
  XOTE_CREATE, XOTE_DEALLOC); this improves create/destroy
  speed by up to 15%
- allocate namespaces for objects less eager
- make naming more consistent
  (change newObj into newObject when variable is an xotcl object)

- get rid of misleading RCS: lines
- passing --prefix to subdirs
- regenerated configure files

- added stefan's expat library linking extension

- define RecreateObject() for internal call via direct invocation
- doCleanup is just called by recreate; merge it into
  XOTclCRecreateMethod.
  Is method cleanup necessary? is recreate not sufficient?
  Delete "cleanup" from internally called methods in next,
  keep it for compatibility in XOTcl

- make XOTcl_FrameDecls transparent (use variable declarations
  in place instead of the macro)
- fix variable shadowing bug in error handling
  (could cause crashes when initcmd lead to errors)

- call all truly essential methods directly if possible
  (Object.destroy, Class.alloc, Class.dealloc, Class.create)
  The basics of XOTcl can work now also in cases,
  when these are not defined as methods.

- handling OBJECT-frames in CallStackPopAll()
  (for handling exit with active stack frames)

- deactivate filters in finalize
- new method InvokeMethodObj() to replace finally CanInvokeDirectly()

- remove some more obsolete RCS Ids
- call Tcl_Objs "Obj", not "Object"

- replace all CanInvokeDirectly() by InvokeMethodObj()

- block call-stack deletes during XOTCL_EXITHANDLER_ON_SOFT_DESTROY;
  however, this seems to create a small leak during exit
  (relevant for threads); so currently, debug still turned on

- fix last issue, with freeing objects, when exit happens from
  higher stack frames

- first part of allowing arbitrary named internally called methods.
- move refcount fixing logic for exit from higher stack-frames to new function: finalObjectDeletion()

- created new functions:
     ObjectSystemFree(), ObjectSystemAdd(), ObjectSystemsCheckSystemMethod(),
     ObjectSystemsCleanup(), GetObjectSystem(), CallDirectly()
  for better separation of systems. We keep track which essential system
  methods are defined and which which methods are potentially overloaded.

- replaced hard-coded method calls for XOTE_DEFAULTMETHOD, XOTE_INIT,
  XOTE_OBJECTPARAMETER with MethodObj()

- renamed MethodObj() to XOTclMethodObj() (it is an exported symbol)
- eliminated XOTE_MOVE
- eliminated XOTE_RESIDUALARGS
- eliminated XOTE_UNKNOWN
- eliminated XOTE___UNKNOWN
- renamed __unknown to requireobject

- provide prefix for internally called methods to distinguish between
  methods called on objects or classes

- handling of minimal object systems. For example, the
  following three command create an object system around
  ::object and ::class ...

   ::xotcl::createobjectsystem ::object ::class
   ::xotcl::alias ::class  + ::xotcl::cmd::Class::create
   ::xotcl::alias ::object - ::xotcl::cmd::Object::destroy

  ... where no internal message dispatch are used (e.g. no
  constructor "init", and where just two methods ("+" and "-")
  are used to create and destroy objects
- extended regression test

- get rid of reminder of tcl 8.4 compatibility and remove range of
  ifdefs, such as PRE85, FORWARD_COMPATIBLE, TCL85STACK,
  CANONICAL_ARGS, USE_COMPILED_VAR_RESOLVER

- rename CallStackPush() to CscInit()
- rename CallStackPop() to CscFinish()

- remove "buffer" from compiled var structures
- remove xotcl1 dependency from aol-tcl
- removed conditional var table creation by assertion
- make clean compile with assertions turned on

- xotcl 1.6.6: make sure to load always xotcl 1 versions when needed
- xotcl 1.6.6: make compilation clean when compiled with assertions on
- xotcl 1.6.6: more cases for the regression test, where we want to load xotcl1 not 2
- xotcl 1.6.6: one more cases for the packaging, where we want to load xotcl1 not 2

- replace hash-lookup in namespace in ObjectHasChildren() by pointer lookup
  to reduce namespace dependency.
- fix memcpy size

- add check for optional match arguments in tcl stub generator
- fix potential memory leaks
  all "definitely losts" from valgrind (except 24 bytes from Tcl_PkgRequire) gone

- fix a potential ordering problem with cyclic dependencies created by
  namespace import commands

- Handle cases, where objects/classes are created with the name
  of pre-exiting namespaces. Cases, where pre-existing namespaces
  contained classes/objects lead to problems, since xotcl did not
  see the object/classes of the pre-exiting namespace as children
  of the new object/class.

- Allow to specify last arg of objectparameter to replace scripted init
  block. The redefinition of objectparameter allows us to specify whether
  no/some/classical/altered/additional arguments should be allowed during
  object creation


- Naming

     namespaces:
       ::next
       ::next-core

     file extension:
       options:
          .tcl
          .xotcl
          .next
          .nxt

    file names:
       composite words with - instead of capitalization

    package names
      next::pkgname
      next::doc-tools   # use - instead of _ or capitalization

    Classes
      use first name capitalized to distinguish from objects

    Objects
      typically, first charaction small

- next::core as namespace name not perfect for addressing variables:
  set ::xotcl::version ${::next-core::version}
  set ::xotcl::patchlevel ${::next-core::patchlevel}

do we need:
  checkMethod  "::next::core::cmd::ParameterType"

- namespace changes:
  mostly due to marketing reasons, the naming of the top-level namespace
  changed from "xotcl2" to "next".
  reasons: xotcl is hard to pronounce for beginners, sounds like "exotic"
  (but who wants to program in an exotic language) has a certain stigma
  of strange naming (e.g. "instproc"), is seen as a precursor of tcloo,
  the top-level namespace ::xotcl2:: is not very nice either, the separation
  of framework and language is not clear.

  We have now:
    ::next (the new object system, former ::xotcl2)
    ::next::core (framework, primitives)
    ::xotcl (former xotcl1)

- "::xotcl::use" no longer needed, use Tcl standard mechanisms instead
  (e.g. "package req next"; "package req XOTcl", "namespace import ::next*")

- [self next] returns
      instead of "proc" and "instproc" => "method"
      instead of "parametercmd" and "instparametercmd" => "setter"
      instead of "instforward" => "forward"
      instead of "instcmd" => "cmd"
   prefixed with the modifier "object" when needed
- [self filterreg] returns
      instead of "instforward" => "forward"
   prefixed with the modifier "object" when needed

-  We have now:
    ::nx (the new object system, former ::xotcl2)
    ::nx::core (framework, primitives)
    ::xotcl (former xotcl1)

- naming next scripting framework
   ::nx::core::existsvar  <==> nx::var exists
   ::nx::core::importvar  <==> nx::var import
   ::nx::core::setvar     <==> nx::var set

- copied infoObjectMethod and infoClassMethod decls as comments
  to xotcl.c, aligned order of method definitions

- removed "[o exists varname]" from next scripting language
- reanimated "info vars" to show locals in eval method
- provide error messages for [objectproperty ... type ...]
- replace 0 by NULL in calls to GetClassFromObj()
- extended regression test

- use size_t where appropriate
- added nonnull annotations

- Implemented "Class info parameter" in Tcl, aliases for xotcl.
  Now both definition of parameters and setting of __parameter are
  in Tcl.

  via set ::nx::core::signature(::nx::Object-method-forward)
  (experimental)
- fixed documentation system to work with actual version
- added undocumented methods for quality control in documentation

- moved some more xotcl specific tests to library/xotcl
- transformed forwardtest from xotcl to next

- moved slottest to library/xotcl
- added new Makefile target test-xotcl
- finished test migration for now
- deactivated __next for now

- iterated through doc.tcl-TODOs
- changed CheckVarName to allow array names like e.g. a(::b)
- extended regression test
- fixed serializer to handle sub-objects of explicitly exported objects

- xotcl.c:
  * new function GetObjectFromNsName() to obtain object or class
    from a fully qualified namespace name used in method handles (such as e.g.
    ::nx::core::classes::X)
  * new function MethodHandleObj() to return a tcl_obj containing the method handle
  * removed obsolete method getFullProcQualifier()
  * info methods obtain now object and/or class from fully qualified method
    names (method handles) if possible
  * return message handles in "current next", "current filterreg" and
    "... info filter ... -order", which can be used in "info method .... "
    for obtaining more details.
  * change all occurrences of "self" in next regression tests to current.
- xotcl2.tcl
  * implemented "self" as a proc to provide extensibility and
    full backward compatibility; this opens opportunity
    to replace now e.g. "self proc" by "current method", etc.
  * provide full compatibility for "self next", "self filterreg" and
    "... info filter ... -order", returning old-style multiword method handles
    (such as e.g. "::C instproc foo")
- changed "next" to current in documentation framework and templates

- updated migration guide, added section for call-stack introspection
- updated serializer for new names

- Introduced $xotcl_target_doc_dir for generated xotcl documentation.
  Generate xotcl documentation in this directory.
- moved more (hopefully all) xotcl doc components into library/xotcl/doc

- added interp alias "nx::self" to "nx::core::current method"
- changed "current proc" into "current method" in scripts and tests

- file extension for next scripting .tcl DONE
- changed ::nx::core to ::nsf

- made the "next scripting language" a own, loadable tcl package
  (currently named nx, name is subject of change)
- predefined.tcl is now pretty minimal.

- updated to TEA 3.8
- moved all exports of nsf to predefined.tcl
- made imports in xotcl2 and nx explicit

- adjusted path in documentation system for nx/nx.tcl

- Implemented "interp alias" support for classes.
  In some cases. interp-aliased classes worked already
  without additional code, but e.g. in "... -superclass C ..."
  it failed. Without this feature, one could not reuse a
  class with a different namespace, unless it was explicitly
  "namespace exported" in the source. The problem was the
  implementation of "::nx::Attribute", which should not be
  exported in nx (most people do a "namespace import ::nx::*")
  because there is no need to do so, but ::xotcl::Attribute
  should reuse it - without subclassing). .... However,
  we still seem to have a problem, when the interp-aliased
  Class is exported and imported to a different namespace.

- info methods shows finally "slots" and "slot". Wanted? Actually no.
- removed definition of slots from nx, changed regression tests
  examples from slots to ::attribute

- replaced several occurrences of "eval" in nx.tcl and xotcl2.tcl

- implemented parameter option "allowempty"
- extended regression test

- commented out XOTCL_CMD_NOT_FOUND, since it seems to be obsolete by now

- additional methodproperty returns (for registering a return value checker)
- support for incrementally adding stuff to paramDefs (such as slotobj or return value)
- new c-function ParamDefsNew()
- added regression test for return value checker

- upgraded to TEA 3.9
- nsf: provided scripted support for "require/provide methods"
- nx: new method ":require namespace" ":require method" "require object method"

- added "method require exists"

- removed method "filtersearch" from nx.tcl
- added "obj info method filter methodName" to nx

- extended regression test
- all methods defined on both, Object and Class are now safe in respect
  to per-object mixins with meta-classes

  (Caused some duplication of logic in the method "object")
_ added option noforwarder to RelationSlots
- some minor cleanup

- removed XOTCL_METHODTYPE_OBJECT from XOTCL_METHODTYPE_BUILTIN
- default methodtype returns now everything, which is a true method
  (except objects)
- methodtype -all includes objects
- the object "slot" does not appear now in the method listing per default
  for classes having slots

- changed __invalidateobjectparameter from a method of class
  to framework primitiv ::nsf::invalidateobjectparameter

- experimental method-property "class-only": this allows to
  make object save against per-object mixins of meta-classes.
  the flag is only used in the mixin-resolver
- used for the time being in nx only for Class.info,
  but would apply as well for methods defined on both Object and Class.

- use now class-only for all methods methods of meta-classes.
  Methods of meta-classes are intended to be applied on classes,
  one should not change this via per-object mixins.
- respect class-only in "info callable methods|method"
- extended regression test

- added parameters for slots "allowemtpy" and "convert"
- extended regression test
- added handling of parameter options "allowemtpy" and "convert"
  in createFromParameterSyntax

- renamed slot attribute "noforwarder" to "nosetter"

- removed overhead on ::nsf::dispatch when called with absolute paths
- absolute paths have to start with ":".

- checked equivalence of the following two commands
  in respect to fully-qualified names
         ::nsf::dispatch $obj ::nsf::cmd::ObjectInfo2::hastype $class
         ::nsf::parametercheck object,type=$class $obj
  extended regression test (parameters.tcl)

- renamed "parameter" into "attributes" in nx
- renamed "info parameter" into "info attributes" in nx
- updated migration guide
- fixed several common typos

- documented behavior of upvar/uplevel with aliases on scripted procs
  through regression test

- implemented next within ensemble methods
- added regression tests for next within ensembles
- added regression tests for upvar with ensembles

- refactored next and argument passing (new methods
  NextGetArguments(), NextSearchAndInvoke() and
  CallStackFindEnsembleCsc())
- doing an internal next in cases where a method
  ensemble does not contain the called submethod
- added regression tests for partial ensembles

- renamed "... info ... subcommands ..." into "... submethods ..."
- renamed tests/subcmd.tcl info tests/submethods.tcl
- moved relevant tests from tests/parameters into tests/submethods.tcl

- renamed functions in nsfStack.c to follow Tcl naming guidelines

- call internal NextSearchAndInvoke (without NextGetArguments)
  from the implicit next in ensemble methods
- made NsfNextMethod() obsolete to ease different noarg handling policies

- new nsf::next cmd. receives 0 or 1 argument, which might be a list
  of arguments. This avoids ambiguity of ::xotcl::next with "--noArgs".
- renamed namespace_copycmds and namespace_copyvars to
  nscopycmds and nscopyvars (we don't use "_" in nsf::*-names as delimiters
  elsewhere)
- renamed __qualify to qualify (it is a non-exported cmd)

- handle next in ensemble with arguments
- extended regression test

- removed obsolete code

- made methods (for now just scripted methods) by default protected.
- provide methode __default_method_protection to obtain the default
  method protection when neither protected or public is used.
- per default methods are now protected
- provide ::nx::configure defaultMethodProtection true|false
  as convenient interface
- update regression test and serializer to handle default protection

- decide on paths for documentation of next and xotcl 2, with
  version numbers; what should be included in distro, what on web-site
- decide on syntax subcomponent. Candidates are
   * Object.method
   * Object->method
   * Object#method

- handling namespaces in documentation
     # @object ::nx::Slot
  vs.
     # @object Slot
  (best allow both variants, write fully qualified name via introspection)
- why only @object? there seems to be no @class. what to do with metaclasses?

- systematic way of specifying results of methods
- systematic way of reporting results in documentation

- handle line-breaking in long @definitions (e.g. @param; e.g. via indented next line)
- danger, tcl-commands in comments (see :method get_unqualified_name)
  especially for code commented out....

- kann man "[:? {[$attr eval {info exists :default}]}" durch "[:?var :@param ..." ausdrücken?
  oder vielleicht besser die variablen mit leerstring initialisieren + infrastruktur anpassen?
- listing von methoden im left-bar, ähnlich http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/docs/YAHOO.util.Connect.html
- "Objects" im left-bar irreführend, sollten eher "Classes" sein. Allerdings sollten
  auch objekte dokumentierbar sein

- doc-tools: was machen die argumente von :? (bspw. ops?); ich nehme an, das ist work in progress.
  sinnvoll wäre: [:?var obj varname body], da viele (die meisten) operationen
  auf anderen objeken ausgeführt werden

- die Dokumentation der Objekt- und Klassenmethoden muss aus gentclapi weg
  und in predefined.tcl und xotcl2.tcl hineinwandern. Es werden nicht alle
  möglichen methoden in next und/oder xotcl2 registiert, ein paar namen sind
  anders, etc.

- fixed a crash for tcl 8.6b1 in return value checking.
  now it complains about missing cmdPtr; it is not clear, why this
  is missing at the first place in 8.6b1 while working in 8.5

- improved library/lib/make.tcl once more
- fixed handling of TclNRRunCallbacks, such that coroutines can be easily
  used (more testing required)
- added temporary routine ::nsf::yieldcheck for coro debugging
- renamed Tcl85showStack() to TclShowStack()

- added error handling to all scripted shells
- removed old xotclsh.in and xowish.in (from apps/utils)

- altered xotcl.m4 to nsf.m4 in
   .,
   library/xotcl/library/store/XOTclGdbm/,
   library/xotcl/library/store/XOTclSdbm/,

  (needed to make serializer more sane, necessary on the longer range)

- reduce size of output of serializer
- make nx::Object.serialize public
- XOTcl 2: allow info slots for objects as well

- serializer:
  * added support for ordering on aliases referencing other objects/classes
  * provide shared version of the method warn via alias
    and removed direct output to stderr

- slots:
  * change name "initcmd" of "experimental slot features" to
    "defaultcmd" to avoid naming conflict the the initcmd executed
    at the initialization of a slot object (effects XOTcl as well)
  * make defaultcmd/valuecmd/valuechangedcmd working for nx
    (absence of trace method)
  * provide error message, when default/defaultcmd/valuecmd are used
    non-exclusively
  * make sure to init per-object slots after copy operations
  * make nx::Attribute.destroy more defensive
  * extend test cases

- nsf: added flag NSF_DESTROY_CALLED_SUCCESS in addition
  to NSF_DESTROY_CALLED to distinguish between attempted
  and successful destroy method invocations (important for
  cleanup)
- fix potential crash in
  ::nx::Object info method definition ::nsf::methods::object::instvar

- "info method submethods": return all submethods, independent
  from protection
- serializer: experimental code to serialize submethods

- new option "-expand" for "obj|class info methods" to
  return compound names (i.e. it lists the full ensemble names)
  Example:
     ::nx::Object info methods -expand "*filter*"
  returns
     filter {info filter guard} {info filter methods} {info lookup filter}
- allow ensemble names in nsf::methodproperty
- fix compound name lookups when aliases link to shared ensemble objects
- make objectName() NULL-safe
- fix option "-source application" when applied directly on base-classes
- extend regression test

- nsf.c: use name "varTablePtr" instead of "varTable" when referring to the table
- new option "slotcontainer" for "methodproperty" to flag slotcontainer to make
  them easier to process in the serializer
. don't report slot container in "info methods -expand"
- new function "::nx::isSlotContainer" to centralize checking for slotcontainers
  (used by serializer)
- support export of method ensembles in serializer

- "info lookup methods": order of non-pos parameters alphabetically
- added option "-expand" to "info lookup methods ". It collects
  ensemble methods along the precedence path
- added support for ensemble methods in "info lookup method"
- extended regression test

- provide full set of ensemble methods from EnsembleObject.unknown
  (i.e.  from all classes along the precedence order. It was necessary
  to pass calling object as first argument)

- "info method parametersyntax" returns now for all nonpos args the
  type instead of "arg" when possible (eg ..... ?-x object? ....)
- extended regression test

- factored out ParamGetType() to obtain from a paramPtr a type string
- parametersyntax:
   * changed "... -x arg ..." into ".... -x value ..."
   * changed multiple values notation from "list" to "..."

- nsf::current: new option "methodpath", returns the full name of an ensemble
  method starting from the ensemble root.
- documented functions in nfsStack.c
- removed obsolete CallStackGetFrame(), replaced by CallStackGetTopFrame()

- push stack frame before calling the defaultcmd of an ensemble object to
  make implementation more simple.
- simplified EnsembleObject.defaultcmd and EnsembleObject.unknown significantly,
  scripted support methods are removed.
- extended regression test for "current methodpath"

- allow %method in forwarder.
- defined unknown methods as call-protected
- make __default_method_protection protected

- added syntax "?arg ...?" in parameter syntax output for "args"
- removed "info forward" from nx::Object and nx::Class
  (can be replaced by "info methods" and "info method")

- Methodpaths can be used now in the definition of "method",
  "alias" and "forward." We do not support it for "setter"
  and "attribute", since these require a parameter spec,
  which does not have clear semantics for a method path.
- scripted definition of nx::Object.forward and nx::Class.forward

- cleanup of __resolve_method_path
- change TclShowStack into NsfShowStack() to avoid possible interference
  with the Tcl* namespace
- made the following function static to avoid pollution of the
  global link namespace: CompiledColonVarFree(), GetRegObject(), ParamGetType()

- changed option -expand in "info methods" and "info lookup methods" into
  "-path" to associate with the method path
- changed method property name from "protected" to "call-protected"
- changed nx::defaultMethodProtection to nx::defaultMethodCallProtection
- nx::defaultMethodCallProtection is used for
  scripted methods, forwarders and aliases
- added nx::defaultAttributeCallProtection,
  used for setter and attributes

- call scripted converters without checking protection
- removed defaultMethodCallProtection from tests/parameters.tcl

- Implemented built-in-converter for "baseclass" and "metaclass".
  Change in performance for this call. >8 times faster
    before: parameters/parametercheck.007:   19.49 mms, ::nsf::is baseclass C
    after:  parameters/parametercheck.007:    2.32 mms, ::nsf::is baseclass C
- remove scripted definition of "baseclass" and "metaclass"

- keep track of defaultMethodCallProtection and defaultAttributeCallProtection
  in serializer
- cleanup aol-xotcl.tcl and document usage in aolserver and naviserver

- iteration over TODO file
- removed obsolete entries from generic/nsf.decls und generic/nsfInt.decls
- removed NSF_CMD_NOT_FOUND

- fixed aliasing warning for gcc 4.4.4
- removed CheckAllInstances()

- added functionality to show enumerated values in
  "info parametersyntax"
- extended regression test

- added experimental code to avoid "variable :x" crash based
  on shadowCommands, but this does not work, when variable is
  bytecompiled. deactivated for now.

- added support for aolserver (essentially Makefile + aol-xotcl.tcl)
- removed unneeded content from serializer output

- the two flags "-objscope" and "-nonleaf" are for adding frames,
  and they are mutual exclusive. Make them a single flag?
  check if both options are in every case sensible.

  possible realizations:
     -scope object|method
     -varscope instance|proc
     -varscope instance|resolver|none
     -frame object|method|default

   * instance|object: within this method, all non-prefixed var names
     refer to instance variables; the method can use most
     probably not "next"
     (actually, only needed for XOTcl)

   * method|proc|resolver: within this method, we can use colon-prefixed
     variables; the method can use "next"

   "object" könnte mit dem -per-object (dem registierungpunkt)
   leicht verwechselt werden. es ginge auch
       -varscope instance|method
   allerdings, meint method eigentlich "scripted method".

   "none" would be dangerous for "-frame", since it could imply
   to avoid frame stacking at all.

   effected are:
     alias, forward, dispatch

   für "alias" betrifft das in gleicher form auch die cmds,
   bei "dispatch" und "forward" gibt es dzt. kein "-nonleaf"

- replaced "-objscope" and "-nonleaf" by
  "-frame object|method|default"
  for nsf::alias and nsf::default
- added functionality for "-frame method" to nsf::dispatch
- made the order of argument in ::nsf::alias and method "alias"
  the same (always first the method, then "-frame ...")
- extended regression test

- renamed some arguments of tcl interface to increase consistency
- make requiredness explicit for nsf::cmds
- introduce ::nsf::parametersyntax to provide syntax for potentially
  missing definitions
- provided ::nsf::parametersyntax for 3 ::nsf commands
  and 7 nx methods (from relationslots)

- fix requiredness of several info methods
- added "nsf::configure debug ?level?"

- use "nsf::configure debug" for
  value 1: complain about protected
  value >1: provide load messages for nx and xotcl
- unset unneeded variables in ::nx namespace

- copied decls for objectMethod and classMethod as comments
  to nsf.c, fixed order
- documented a few functions

- enabled nsf::__db_run_assertions in nx::test
  (lead before to false positives in destroy-test)
- eliminated deleted objects and objects from deleted
  namespaces in GetAllInstances()

- added handling of unstacked csc entries (removed all DEBUG warnings).

- made handling of unstacked entries optional by defining
  macro CHECK_ACTIVATION_COUNTS)
- added macro NSF_DEVELOPMENT for toplevel handling
  if NDEBUG and CHECK_ACTIVATION_COUNTS
- cleanup of method-modifiers.tcl
- updated next migration guide

- follow current Tcl convention for patchlevel var:
  - changed name of ::nsf::patchlevel to ::nsf::patchLevel
  - changed content ::nsf::patchLevel from eg .0 to full
    number including release details

- fixed bug in ::variable with colon-prefixed name
  (shadowCommands does not help, see above)
- removed traces of Nsf_VariableObjCmd()
- extended regression test

- provided parametersyntax definitions for XOTcl 2.0
  similar to nx for all methods without a spec
 (e.g. fur builtin Tcl cmds, forwarders)

- make sure not to return CompiledLocal vars
  from InterpColonVarResolver() when TCL_NAMESPACE_ONLY
  is requested.
- delegate always from InterpColonVarResolver() to
  other resolvers, when TCL_NAMESPACE_ONLY is requested.

- implemented exported command ::nsf::self as fast convenience
  replacement for "::nsf::current object".

- removed bug-alert from nx.tcl (wrong false-positives for
  compiled locals in slots)
- added a few small optimization. nsf appears to run on
  the shootout benchmark the same speed like a year ago
  (which much less functionality)

- added a few more small optimization.
- code-generator: don't call argument parser,
  when no arguments are specified

- fixed bug when calling aliased proc not via method interface
- fixed bug when calling destroy in initcmd

- allowed public|protected for method deletion
  such as "Object public method foo {} {}"
- removed defaultMethodCallProtection in alias test
- extended regression tests for aliases to procs
- renamed nx regression tests .test to follow tcl conventions
- added regression tests for destroy-during-init
- removed debugging from NsfCleanupObject when compiled without DEVELOPMENT
- removed debugging from CscFinish when compiled without DEVELOPMENT

- changed CallStackGetActiveProcFrame() to return also CMETHD frames
  This allows to execute :volatile in a initcmd and to delete the
  object at its end. As a consequence, code like
     [CopyHandler new -volatile] copy [::nsf::self] $newName
  has to be changed to
      CopyHandler new {
       :copy [:uplevel ::nsf::self] [uplevel set newName]
       :destroy
      }
- renamed CallStackUseActiveFrames() to CallStackUseActiveFrame()
  and ctx->framesSaved to ctx->frameSaved to reflect implementation

- new function MethodNameString() to obtain name without colon prefix
  from tcl_obj
- fix bad interaction between filters and cmd name resolvers
- output object frame to ease interpretation of [info frame]

- fixed scoping issue, when "-volatile" was used for object creation
- added regression test for interaction between filters and
  function resolver (and volatile)
- reactivated new volatile test in destroy.test
- undone temporary fixes for volatile in serializer and nx.tcl
- improved NsColonVarResolver, made some assumptions explicit

- gentclApi.tcl: added optimizer rule for single argument of type tclobj
- improved speed of CompiledLocalsLookup slightly

- added an experimental code for setting parent namespace path as
  default for child-objects. At the time when an object namespace is
  created, the namespace path of the parent object is copied to the
  child as default value.

- added new contains definition based on "apply" instead of
  "namespace eval". Main intention is to replace SKIP_LEVELS
  by SKIP_LAMBDA
- added functionality to use ":attribute contains:method,nosetter"
- added regression test for contains and attributes of type method

- activated SKIP_LAMBDA in nsfCallstack. As a consequence, we
  disallow resolving self/my ... from tcl-proc frames
  (use uplevel if necessary, avoid "namespace eval")

- improving error messages from argument parser
- test "namespace current" and "self" in "contains" and "slots" regression test
- added "nosetter" automatically, when attribute "<name>:method" is used

- fix a bug, where "o configure" (without arguments) resetted
  initialized values to the defaults.
- show "unwind unstacked entry" message appear only when debug level>0
- removed fixed TODO entries

- New function NsfNamespaceInit() to initialize pre-existing
  namespaces in PrimitiveOInit() and in RequireObjNamespace()
- provide error message, when provided setter name starts with a colon

- Make sure that DispatchDestroyMethod() calls as well protected destructors
- New function NSCheckNamespace() as replacement for NSCheckForParent()
- pass parentNsPtr around instead of recomputing it in NSCheckForParent()
- removed unneeded argument from NSGetFreshNamespace()
- switched to DString operations in NameInNamespaceObj() (seems slightly faster)
- factored out NSRequireParentObject()
- by the measures above, we obtained some speed improvements
- moved some more debug output to be controlled by the debug-level
- extended regression test with testcases for creation of parent
  objects via method "__unknown"

- disallow object parameter of type "switch" to avoid possible
  confusion between (a) providing a value for the o.p., (b) calling
  it as a setter, and (c) calling it as a getter. For providing a
  value, no arg is used for switch. For calling a setter, it is
  necessary to provide a value even for a switch.
- disallow type "switch" in setter definiton (use boolean instead)
- disallow type "switch" for positional arguments (use boolean instead)
- extended regression test

- configure.in: removed --with-tclinclude option, since it
  appears to be included in tcl.m4 (since a while). Many thanks
  to Victor Guerra for noticing it.

- perform relation handling in objectparameters outside of object-frame

- For preexisting namespaces, we do not set the deleteProc.  Is this
  desired? Should nsPtr->deleteProc be moved to NsfNamespaceInit()?
  .... It is ok on the current labor distribution between object and
  namespace: if an object is deleted, it takes care about the deletion
  of sub-objects, not the namespace. However, it might be an option in
  the future to overthink this strategy and to bush (sub)object
  deletion into the namespace deletion.

- work on replacing SKIP_LEVELS by SKIP_LAMBDA for OpenACS (works with
  regression test, has problems with OrderedComposite::ChildManager.init)
  Note concerning treating CMETHOD_FRAME like METHOD_FRAMES: we did
  this change for NsfCallStackFindLastInvocation(), but nsfStack.c has
  still several occurrences, where they are treated differently.

- changed relation handling by evaluating the relationcmd in the parent
  context to keep evaluation order.
- extend introspection "nsf::configure objectsystem": the command
  returns now all system methods in the syntax of nsf::createobjectsystem
- "nsf::createobjectsystem" creates now a warning when an existing
  objectsystem is redefined and ignores the new definition attempt.
  This was done with the purpose to allow
  "package forget nx; package require nx"
- Allow overwriting of redefine protected method during bootstrap
  to ease "package forget nx; package require nx"
- forward had just "-objscope", no general "-frame method|object".
  Since forwarder have client data, they always push a method frame.
  So, the situation is different to nsd::alias and ::nsf::dispatch.
  Therefore, the flag "-objscope" was renamed to "-objectframe"
  to provide better consistency with "-frame object"
- fixed bug, where error handling of invalid options in
  ForwardProcessOptions() could lead to a crash
- return forwardoption "-earlybinding" via introspection
- extended regression test

- provide a more explicit way to handle resourcing after a "package
  forget" in the info methods (similar to Stefan's suggestion).

- xotcl2.tcl: added empty namespace eval to make package indexer happy
- nx.tcl: removed debugging output
- nx.tcl: added syntactic sugar to "method" and "alias" for
  return value checking. One can write now:
     Class create C {
       :public method foo {a:int b:int} -> int {
          return [expr {$a + $b}]
       }
     }
- extended regression test

- changed returns syntax from '->' to '-returns'
- xotcl2: fixed and completed results of "info instforward" and "info forward"
- serializer: fixed handling of nsf::configure options

- nx: added "-returns" to forwarder
- added regression test for forwarder and returns

- rebuild pkgIndex.tcl more eagerly
- added error handler to pkg_mkIndex when called via "make libraries-pkgindex"
   * just show warning and errors when rebuilding pkgIndex files
   * stop make in case of errors in pkg_mkIndex

- don't leave error message when __default_superclass (or
  __default_metaclass) is not set

- Fixed switching between INACTIVE_MIXIN frames to ACTIVE_MIXIN frames
- Extended regression test

- make handling of redefinitions in system methods more robust
- follow Tcl naming convention (uppercase functions)

- Don't allow to call objects as methods (for the time being) via
  absolute names. Otherwise, in line {2} below, ::State is
  interpreted as an ensemble object, and the method "unknown"
  won't be called (in the XOTcl tradition).
     {1} Class ::State
     {2} Class ::State -parameter x

- Converted migration guide to asciidoc
- Overhaul of several sections in asciidoc
- Developed styles for nx for migration guide (.css and source-highlight)

- fixed bug in xotcl 2.0 "info forward"
- extended regression test

- NSDeleteChildren: delete objects before classes
- NSDeleteChildren: delete here aliases as well
- fix potential crash when "next" is called from a non-proc frame.

- nx.tcl: cleanup of forward implementation
- xotcl2.tcl: cleanup of forward implementation
- xotcl2.tcl: provide debug version of default init method

- nsf.c: acquire parameter structure for returns more lazily
  (otherwise, a serializer handling returns would acquire the
  structure for every argument)
- extend regression test

- xotcl2.tcl: fix the default init handler
- nsf.c: provide warnings when unchecked parameter values might conflict with nonpos args

- provide a generic logging interface
  * predefined for plain Tcl and aolserver/naviserver
  * C-level: NsfLog()
  * Tcl-level: ::nsf::log

- quote name of referenced parameter in error message to ease reading
- new parameter checker "parameter", performing an approximate checking
  for valid parameter specs
- set NSF_ARG_CHECK_NONPOS only when there are multiple arguments
- remove space checking in values for NSF_ARG_CHECK_NONPOS in favor of parameter checker

- make "... info children ?pattern?" compliant with XOTcl 1;
  if pattern contains no wildcard and is no absolute path, nsf completes it.
  (eg. Object create o; Object create o:x; o info children x" will return ::o::x)
- extended regression test

- introduced a few forms of multiplicity
   * 0..1 allow empty value
   * 0..* list, can be empty (equivalent to 0..n)
   * 1..* list, cannot be empty (equivalent to 1..n)
- deprecate multivalued in parameter specs in favor of multiplicity
- deprecate allowempty in parameter specs in favor of multiplicity
- adjust regression test

- fixed bug with required last object parameter without provided value
- extended regression test

- new printf-style error message generator: NsfPrintError()
- simplified error handling: removed NsfVarErrMsg() and NsfErrMsg()
  and replaced it by NsfPrintError()

- testx.xotcl: fix messages when test fails
- further cleanup of error procs: eliminated NsfObjErrArgCnt()
- improve error message, when too many arguments are passed

- extended und overworked migration guide (added e.g. multiplicity)
- extended regression test

- added returns handling for nx in serializer
- extended regression test

- provide warning if non-positional argument is passed more than once

- made error messages more consistent
- improved error messages for "returns" and "nsf::is" (omit parameter name)

- streamlined error messages
- removed NsfErrBadVal() and replaced it with a generalized version of NsfObjErrType()

- "/obj/ info method parametersyntax /method/": return results of
  ::nsf::parametersyntax in case, the parametersyntax cannot obtained
  from a parameter definition (e.g. the method is a forwarder to a tcl
  cmd).

doctools
- interfaces in documentation for slots (see for more details
  ::nx::Class#superclass in nx.tcl)
- handle object methods as well in quality checks
- why does one have to specify @superclass rather than determining the
  superclass via introspection?
- use tcl parametersyntax for short description of commands/methods

- deal with internally called methods (can be overloaded by the application)
      * user-called and internally called (e.g. from "create" or "new")
        XO_c_create_idx, XO_o_destroy_idx, XO_o_move_idx,
     * not documented yet:
        XO_c_requireobject_idx, XO_o_defaultmethod_idx, XO_o_init_idx,
        XO_o_objectparameter_idx, XO_o_unknown_idx
     * only XOTCL2:
        XO_o_cleanup_idx, XO_o_residualargs_idx,
text
   - use term "callprotection" in documentation for public|protected
     (to be consistent with "... info methods ...")
   - reduce indenting for code examples in documentation
    (high indentation makes readability worse).
    i use usually just 2, 4 are ok as well; we should decide.

- defined UNUSED macro to get more checking on unused arguments

- nx::pp: added flag "-linenumbers on|off" to render method
- added first version of next-tutorial.[txt|html]

- xotcl2.tcl: defined ::xotcl::MetaSlot
- make sure, that classes of the intrinsic class hierarchy are
  of the same object system
- add regression test

- removed c-implementation of method vwait, it was replaced
  by "vwait :varName". We had to allow flag TCL_GLOBAL_ONLY
  in InterpColonVarResolver(), since Tcl vwait implementation
  calls it with that flag.
- added a scripted implementation for vwait in xotcl2
- added regression test for vwait
- removed TCL_VWAIT from the code, since we have it in git

- nx.tcl: defined method unknown as protected
- nx.tcl: never pass "substdefault" to a setter
- nx.tcl: define a minimal value-checker any to suppress warnings
   for potential conflicts with non-positional parameters, when the
   values start with a dash

- doc-tools.tcl: make -name parameter of method new always required and "any"
- doc-tools.tcl: make object parameter of Entity of type "any"

- nsf.c: added wideinteger to list of value-checkers
- nsf.c: provide context for warning messages
- extended regression test

- next-tutorial: documentation updates
- add explicit reference counting for oacs-style flag value passing

- parameter specs: use "arg=" in object parameter type "method" as
  name of a called method to allow to call unregistered methods
- eliminate protected method "noinit" for nx and allow it just as an
  object parameter

- added first implementation of object parameter type "forward"
- renamed object parameter type "method" to "alias"
- removed parameter option "slotobj=" in toParameterSyntax
- renamed to [from|to]parameterSyntax to [from|to]parameterSpec

- serializer.tcl: reactivated methodSerialize
  (used in api-browser of OpenACS)

- nx.tcl:
   * new method requireClass to Combine two classes and return the
     more specialized one
   * make slot objects for parameter aliases and parameter forwarder
     instances of ObjectParameterSlot
   * get rid of attributes "isforward" and "isalias" and replace it
     by "disposition"
   * complete list of predefined value checkers
   * we have now three approaches for providing parameter
     -object-filter and -object-method
        Approach 1: create RelationSlot with nosetter
        Approach 2: use parameter forwarder
        Approach 3: use parameter alias
     we switched from approach 1 to approach 3
- extended regression test

- fixed potential crash with missing parent namespace

- added shadowing for ::tcl::info::body to allow "info body"
  to be called on ::nsf::procs
- commented nsfShadow.c
- added regression test
- removed NSF_INFO

- fixed potential access to freed memory (actually when checking if
  namespace was removed by Tcl); found this problem when compiling Tcl
  with SYSTEM_MALLOC (own modified version of tclThreadAlloc.c)
- fixed memory leak (namespace names and structures)

- nx.tcl:
   * full rewrite of slot machinerie, much simpler structure
   * relation handling via parameter aliases instead of pseudo converter
   * mixinclass SlotOptimizer removed
   * new class BootStrapAttributeSlot

- ConvertToRelation() and handling of parametertype "relation"
- Make CompiledColonVarFetch() more robust in case of
  half initialized objects (create vartable on the fly if needed)
- allow empty parameter options in parameter parser
- removed nsf::parametersfromslots (became simple, part of objectparameter now)
- removed hardcoded objectparameter (attributes, volatile and noinit)
- updated regression test
- updated class diagram

- nx.tcl: needsForwarder is true, when method "get" is specified on a slot
- nx.tcl: Don't generate per-slot add/assign handlers, when not needed

- nsf.c: fixed a nasty bug within namespace deletion, when a deletion
  of one tcl cmd caused implicit deletions of other cmds in the same
  namespace. The classical idiom for looking over hash tables with
  Tcl_GetHashValue() and Tcl_NextHashEntry(hSrch) can lead to crashes
  (and has different behavior depending on the number of buckets).
- added regression test

- nx.tcl: added default/initcmd for ObjectParameterSlot
- added ::nx::Object as default for "superclass" slot
  to make default superclass explicit
- unified interface for getParameterOptions
- extended regression test
- update class diagram of slots

- new function Nsf_NextHashEntry() simular Tcl_NextHashEntry(),
  but handles triggered hash entry deletions
- fixed reference count in AliasDeleteObjectReference()

- nsf.c: changed handling of cmdPtrs in call-stack content.
   * we use now explicit reference counting using
     NsfCommandPreserve/NsfCommandRelease
   * as a consequence, we do not need the following
     functions Nsf_DeleteCommandFromToken() and
     CallStackClearCmdReferences() any more.
   * the flag NSF_CSC_OBJECT_ACTIVATED is not needed
     anymore and was removed

- removed a small memory leak when a destroy method of an object o
  deletes its grandparents namespace, containing also this class of o
  (and its methods). Significantly eased by the change above.

- use NsfCommandPreserve/NsfCommandRelease for tcd->aliasCmd as well.
  In case of epoched cmdPointers, refetch the cmd and it client data.
- added regression tests

- added flag to AliasGet() to leave optional error message if alias
  data is removed
- some cleanup in NsfProcAliasMethod(): handle not existing alias data,
  more careful refcounting

- added experimental flag WITH_IMPORT_REFS to deactivate automated
  alias deletion (seems, that this solves all issues we had before)
- added flushing of bytecode on alias registration
- added regression test

- update slot UML diagram
- fixed incorrect (unwanted) call to unknown that caused creation
  of objects names __unknown when classes could not be resolved
- nsf::relation: fixed error message when receiving and invalid
  class for relation type "class"

- updated documentation
- reanimated NSF_PROFILE (when activated, needs more stack and slows execution slightly down)

- fixed a problem with object-level alias
- nsf.c: provide low-level commands for managing profile data
- nsfStack.c: provide hook to obtain callers information in profiling code

- nx.tcl: provide caching for computed values of object slots to make
  method objectparameter nearly twice as fast; direct changes on slots
  require a reconfigure call.
- nsf.c: removed SUBST from shadow commands (does not appear to be
  necessary any more)
- nsf.c: fixing a memory leak (some substituted values were not freed correctly)
- nsf.c: fix potential crash for epoched cmds
- some minor updates for profiling support

- The fix of yesterdays subst reference counting bug triggered an
  other problem: If the last arg was "args", the flags array for
  checking the need for decr of refcounts was not extended. There are
  multiple possible fixes, i have just extended the flags array for
  now as well.
- When profiling is activated, perform now a more sane shutdown order,
  all hash tables are now correctly freed.
- Improve behavior, when object system creation fails
- Drop function NsfProfilePrint()

- Altered Nsf_NextHashEntry() to re-init hSrchPtr when the number
  of expected entries differs from the number of real entries. This
  fixes a bug that Michael Aram detected, that happens when multiple
  hash buckets exist, but on deletion of an hash entries triggers
  some other deleted from the same hash table.
- extended regression test.

- made default setting more compatible with XOTcl 1
  * set variables to defaults only when not set already
  * flag init_called already before init is called, not afterwards
    (a call to "configure" within init does not clear the already
    set instance variables)
- extend regression test

- configure: added flag --with-profile to enable profiling support
- cleanup and documentation of nsf-specific interp state
- nsf::configure: added an option "profile on|off" (per default off)
- profiling: return object data with method information

- the following is obsolete since valgrind 3.6

====================

- doc:
   * This package contains 12 classes.... 3 objects ....
     Why are all these marked with "mismatch"?
   * (optional) protected method elimination in left bar
   * heading "Glossary" missing.
     It ist not clear, what the list of items is, when one sees index.html
   * make quality checks (missing documentation, ...) optional?
     how to deal with non-resolvable quality checks?
   * provide a renderer for XOTcl @-notation to produce object structure
     for the new doctool (makes the old documentation usable, eg. for XOTcl2)

- first steps towards DTrace support
- DTrace:
   * track objects in method invocations
   * trace result codes in method-return
   * add some DTrace sample scripts
   * add DTrace header file dependency
   * add --enable-dtrace flag for configure
   * --enable-dtrace sets DTRACE_OBJ on mac os x empty (since not needed for mac os x DTrace)
   * added "nsf::configure dtrace on|off" for skipping package initialization
     (to be handled in D script)
   * make compilation clean
   * extended README file
   * handle self->tracing in D scripts (and in dtrace/sample.tcl, tests/object-system.tcl)
   * add probes for object creation and freeing
   * add sample d-script for object bookkeeping
   * renamed object-create into object-alloc (counterpart of object-free, no confusion with create)
   * fire probes as well for classes created by the object system

- configure
   * make "configure --help" more pretty
   * simplify configure.in

- added first version of "nsf::methoddelete"
- extended regression test
- updated TODO

- fixed potential crash with -param:switch
- added "... info method exists ...."
- updated migration guide

- changed names of method handling commands in nsf:
   ::nsf::methodproperty => ::nsf::method::property
   ::nsf::method         => ::nsf::method::create
   ::nsf::methoddelete   => ::nsf::method::delete
   ::nsf::alias          => ::nsf::method::alias
   ::nsf::forward        => ::nsf::method::forward
   ::nsf::setter         => ::nsf::method::setter
   ::nsf::provide_method => ::nsf::method::provide
   ::nsf::require_method => ::nsf::method::require
 (updated regression test, docs, ...)


- Fixed cases of -flag=$value for type switch outside the context of
  "nsf::procs -ad"
- extended regression test

- removed hardcoded name "init" from CallConfigureMethod()
- improved documentation
- removed isInitString()

- changed names of var handling commands in nsf:
   ::nsf::existsvar => ::nsf::var::exists
   ::nsf::importvar => ::nsf::var::import
   ::nsf::setvar    => ::nsf::var::set

- improved misleading error message for method modifiers "public" and
  "protected", as well as for "class-object"
- extended regression test

- serializer: catch for object-level alias apparently
  not needed anymore (search for ns_cache_flush)
- silence compilation when compiled without DTrace

- nx:
  * removed methods ::nx::Class.alloc and
    ::nx::Class.dealloc from predefined method-set

  * added definitions such that these methods can be loaded via
      ::nsf::method::require ::nx::Class alloc
      ::nsf::method::require ::nx::Class dealloc

  * make explicit that "method ... require" returns a method-handle

  * removed misleading reference in error message, when a class-spefic
    method was called on an object; solution is somewhat dangerous for
    potentially unknown client data

  * added regression tests

  * removed methods ::nx::Class.recreate and
    ::nx::Class.recreate from predefined method-set
    ::nx::Object.configure from predefined method-set


  * added definitions such that these methods can be loaded via
      ::nsf::method::require ::nx::Class recreate
      ::nsf::method::require ::nx::Object configure

nsf:
  * added CallDirectly() wrapper for calls to "init"

 * reactivated "configure", since we plan to use it more prominently
 * added a configure flag for "class"
 * removed method "class" (should be used via "/obj/ configure -class ...")
 * removed method residualargs from nx

 * added C-implemented method "init" for orthogonality
 * allow specification of system method handles in nsf::createobjectsystem
 * automatically register alias, when system-method handle
   was provided and a same-named method is defined

* provided a fast path implementation for "defaultmethod"
* provided default system methods for "init", "defaultmethod" and "unknown"
* provided handles for system methods "alloc", "dealloc", "recreate", and
  "defaultmethod"
* strip in dispatch invocations of "unknown" potential leading colons
* removed c-level implementation of init again, since scripted one can
  be used now as well in registration of createobjectsystem
* reduced verbosity
* added definitions such that these methods can be loaded via
    ::nsf::method::require ::nx::Object unknown

* added methods ::nsf::methods::object::class and
  ::nsf::methods::class::superclass in order to make faster and nicer
  looking objectparameters (compared with forwarders)
* nx: changed parameter -class to use ::nsf::methods::object::class
* ns: fixed chicken egg problem of method objectparameter needing
  objectparameter by creating/destroying slot Class::slot::dummy;
  otherwise default values for slots would not be available
* reduced verbosity of parameter forwarder

* Hopefully the last big naming change:
  Instead of writing "C class-object method foo {} {...}"
  one can write now "C class method foo {} {...}" to define
  a class method named "foo" for class "C". This naming change
  became possible by defining XOTcl's "class" (and "superclass")
  as object parameter only. To change a class of an object o,
  one has to use "o configure -class NEWCLASS". The term
  "object-class" looks alien to language beginners, the term
  "class" is much more straightforward. Changing classes
  or superclasses is seldomly used by typical application programs.

  For already existing nx scripts, changing "object-class" into
  class should be straightforward.

* various documentation updates (migration guide, nx tutorial)
* fixed bad interaction between filter and parameter alias

* some documentation/todo updates

* fix compilation for tcl-head in fossil
* deactivate coro regression test, since it is apparently broken
  for tcl-head in fossil (stack frame seems to be lost after a yield)

* make sure to create the cmds for objects with Tcl_NRCreateCommand()
  to choose trampoline-path in the trunk version of Tcl

* The newest trunk version of Tcl in fossil has TclStackFree() and
  TclStackAlloc() removed We had to substitute this
  functions. Unfortunately, the lifetime of the strack structures has
  changed, so we had shuffle some internals around.

- nsf.c: remove unnecessary test when compiled without NRE
- nsf.c: make sure, validCscPtr is always initialized
- tested all regression tests with valgrind against tcl-trunk

- gentclAPI.tcl:
  * renamed "nsfCmd" to simply "cmd", since the code can generate arbitrary
    tcl commands
  * allow type "int" in the .decl files
- nsf.c
  * move several functions from "static" to "external" to make
    the code generator usable for submodules as well

- added flag ?-type ...? to "info lookup slots"
- made all useful converters external symbols
- added flag ?-type ...? to "info slots"
- delete accessor when slot is destroyed
- added pattern to "info slots"
- added to "info slot /attName/"

- Fixed dispatch of defaultmethod for ensemble methods
- Added compile flag DISPATCH_ALWAYS_DEFINED_METHODS (deactivated).
  So far, nx just uses dispatch on overloads or filters, but not on
  defines (possible to call e.g. "destroy" from a script, but
  internally the direct dispatch is used, as long there is no
  overload). The compileflag would force to use the slower
  dispatch always.
- Extended regression test
- Improve locality

- Let "info slot" return the slot object
- nx::mongo: Initial commit of the experimental mongoDB interface for nx

- nx.tcl: fix handling of arg in converter
- nx::mongo:
  * first step towards handling embedded objects
  * one more example script: example-nx-bi.tcl

- nsf:c: fix dispatch of setter without current method
- extended regression tests

- nsf.c: added nsf::var::unset (provided so far just var::set)
- nx::mongo:
  * added mongo::count
  * obtain _id from mongo::insert
  * added mongo::Object.delete method for embedded and
    non-embedded objects
  * handling of mongo-embedded objects when destroying objects
  * simple bson pretty print function
  * extended examples
  * handle fetch of embedded objects
  * added method count for mongo mapped classes
  * improve documentation
  * added handling of bson types for timestamps and dates
  * provide setup based on mongo_db, mongo_collection and mongo_ns
  * implemented type "reference" similar to "embedded"
  * all referenced objects are for the time being auto-dereferenced
  * new method "show" for mongo mapped classes
  * added two new example files example-nx-reference-many.tcl and
    example-nx-reference-one.tcl
  * replaced "arg" by "type" in spec for mongo attributes to make
    spec less strange

- nsf.c: made potentially unknown clientData more safe (error message,
  when something is passed via clientData to a method expecting
  an object/class as clientData).
- renamed NsfNoDispatchObjectError() to NsfDispatchClientDataError(),
  extended interface
- Makefile.in: fixed name methods.test
- nsf: renamed nsf::isobject to nsf::object::exists
- nsf: renamed nsf::qualify to nsf::object::qualify

- nx.tcl: added support for positional object parameter and
  removed special handling of the last argument for the init block;
  added attributes "position" and "positional" to ObjectParameterSlots,
  removed last argument of method "objectparameter"
- nx.tcl: simplified createBootstrapAttributeSlots
  (second round of default value setting seems not necessary)
- nx.tcl: some cleanup

- test.tcl:
  * don't export Test per-default
  * define Test as nx::Test
  * make Test parameter count 1 the default, change to higher numbers where needed

- nsfmongo.c:
  * upgrade to newest c-driver (version 0.3) from git.
  * support connection to replica sets
  * support attribute selection lists for ::mongo::query
    (positive and negative selection)
- nx-mango.tcl:
  * support for unique indices
  * support for query operators "in" and "all"

- extended migration guide (introduction, feature lists, etc.)

- serializer:
  * prefix warnings to ease tracking of warnings
  * some cleanup for handling aliased methods

- nsf.c:
  * moved implementation of ::nsf::method::delete to C
  * produce same error messages when methods are delete
    via nsf::method::delete and nsf::method::create {} {}
  * Prohibit deletion of methods during shutdown. Otherwise
    when destructors delete methods, some other destructors
    depending on these methods will fail. Cleanup deletes
    all methods anyway.
  * Provided alternative (faster) way of dispatching
    nsf::procs (can be tured off with NSF_INVOKE_SHADOWED_TRADITIONAL)
  * renamed NsfMethodCmd() into NsfMethodCreateCmd() for consistency
  * nsf works with OpenACS again (requires new nstrace.tcl,
    aolserver-openacs.tcl, and 01-debug-procs.tcl).

- nsf.c:
  * factor out NsfClassListAddPerClassMixins()
  * factor out NsfClassListFind()
  * let result of "cls info heritage" return per-class mixins
    as well, otherwise it would be useless, since
    "cls info superclass -closure" would return the same
  * replaced loops with NsfClassListFind()

- nsf.c:
  * handle direct dispatches for aliased methods
  * new generalized error message: NsfNoCurrentObjectError()

- nx.tcl: replace loops ::nsf::methods::[object|class]::*
  by explicit command registrations

- nsf.c:
  * added NsfClassListNoDup() to allow just single inserts
  * added NsfClassListPrint() for debugging
  * info heritage returns no duplicates
  * added prototype for NsfNoCurrentObjectError()
  * report "no current object" when no object is
    passed to a method.
  * code cleanup
- extended regression test

- nsf.c:
  * ensure that explicit per-object-mixins are kept at the front in "info
    heritage" order and in "info precedence" when classes are added as
    POMs and PCMs
  * extended regression test

- nsf.c:
  * renamed old flag "-order" of "info mixin classes" to "-heritage"
    since it computes same heritage as in "info heritage" (but
    potentially for a list of classes)
  * added compatibility layer for xotcl2
  * added lost option "-heritage" to "/cls/ info mixin classes"
    (was only there for "/obj/ info mixin classes")
  * extended regression test

- nsf.c
  * first version of c-bases "info slots" for classes
  * switch "-closure" just for class info method
  * added switch "-source" to "info slots -closure"
    and "info lookup slots"
    (similar to "info lookup methods")
  * extended regression test
  * base objectparameter on "info slots"

- nsf.c
  * added "pattern" to "info lookup slots"
  * added "pattern" to "info slots"
  * extended regression test

- nx.tcl, xotcl2.tcl: removed unsafe {*}$pattern
- added:
   "info slot handle /name/"
   "info slot parameter /name/"

- nsf.c: Since the method "objectparameter" is just based on the class
  (and object parameters are invalidates as well over the class), we
  moved the method from obj to class to avoid potential confusions

- nsf:c
  * added C-implemented class level method
    "info objectparameter list|name|parameter|parametersyntax"
  * added enum to handle different print styles for parameters
  * renamed ParamDefsList() to ParamDefsNames(), added true ParamDefsList()

- nx.tcl:
  * removed "info slot handle" and "info slot parameter"
  * added "info parameter spec", "info parameter list",
    "info parameter name", and "info parameter syntax"
  * extended regression test

- nsf.c:

  * Added argument "-reg-object" to ::nsf::method::create to
    distinguish between a registration and a definition object for
    ensemble methods, similar as on other places.  If no reg-object is
    provided, it is the same as the definition object.  One should
    take care that the registration objects are deleted after the
    definition objects, which is the case for the usages of the
    reg-objects in nx/xotcl.
  * The namespaces within plain scripted methods and scripted
    ensemble objects are now the same.
  * Extended regression test
  * Code cleanup and documentation

- nx.tcl:
  * added method "delete" to delete methods and attributes
  * extended regression test

- nsf.c: removed all but one occurrence of Tcl_AppendElement()
- nsf.c: removed all occurrences of Tcl_AppendElement()
- nsf.c: passed around resultObj explicitly
- nsf.c: fix and document GetMatchObject()
- extend regression test

- nx.tcl:
  * splitted method "delete" into a "delete method" and
    "delete attribute"
  * remove flag "-per-object" in method "delete"
  * delete per-object methods of classes with
    "/cls/ class delete method name" and
    "/cls/ class delete attribute name"
  * extended regression test

- added test cases for "info slots"

- nsf.c:
   * handling of same named per-object and provided slots for Class objects
   * per-object slots are saved now under <obj>::per-object-slot::*
   * returning correct results when per-object slots are used
   * removed obsolete functions: NsfObjectListFree(), NsfObjectListAdd()
   * removed obsolete type NsfObjects
   * transformed ComputeSlotObjects() into a more generic AddSlotObjects()
     that can handle per-object slots as well

- nx.tcl:
   * generalized slot object handling.
   * extended regression test

- xotcl2:tcl
   * made "info heritage" in xotcl2 compatible with xotcl1
   * fixed "info slots" in xotcl2
   * extended regression test

- nsf.c: require NSF_IS_SLOT_CONTAINER for slot-container
- nx.tcl: ne proc ::nx::setSlotContainerProperties to handle slot
  container properties in a uniform way
- reduce verbosity
- nx.tcl: improve code documentation

-nsf.c: added c-implementation of "/object/ info slots" to
  share implementation details and reduce scattering

- migration guide
  * included change in "info heritage"
  * included "info slots"
  * included "info parameter"
  * included "delete method"
  * included "delete attribute"

- nsf.c: NsfRelationCmd() returns per default list of actual
  values, therefore mixin add|... return now as well the
  actual values

- nx.tcl: added "info parameter slot" to return slotobject(s)
- added "info parameter slot" to migration guide
- extended regression test

- nsf.c: changes to use trunk-branch with and without TclStackAlloc()
- migration-guide: add third level to toc
- fix regression test for 8.6 to use nx prefix

- nsf.c: added cmd "::nsd::method::registered /handle/" that returns
  the object on which the method identified by the handle was registered,
  or empty.
- extended regression test

- bring defined commands in the source code in alphabetical order
- generate interface for NsfUnsetUnknownArgsCmd()
- delete some obsolete code

- added "link" from 2.4 (parameters) to "info parameters" in migration
  guide
- remove alias warnings from gcc under ubuntu (4.2.4)

- nsf.c: fixed possible crash in tcl8.6 with nsfprocs, still one inconsistency
- nsf.c: fixed bad interaction between mixins and ensembles in tcl8.6
- nsf.c: document two more functions
- nsf.c: removed unneeded casts to (ClientData)

- nsf.c: generalized disposition handling (forward, alias, initcmd) for
  object parameter
   * disposition is now an option for object parameters rather than
     than an own type. Therefore, one can check the arguments passed
     to the disposition cases
   * changed specification of name of method from arg= to method=
   * this way "type" info in "info parameter syntax" is handled automatically

- nsf.c:
  * added a new converter for converting mixins with guards (named mixinspec)
  * used mixinspec in nx.tcl and xotcl2.tcl
  * extended nx regression test.

* added profiling support for nsf::proc when
  NSF_INVOKE_SHADOWED_TRADITIONAL is turned off.

- removal of unneeded flags "-incontext" and "-nomixins" from
   * /obj/ info methods
   * /cls/ info methods
  These flags are correct for "info lookup", but unneeded for
  "info methods"
- cleanup of ListDefinedMethods()

- nsf.c: use NsfObjectRefCountIncr() instead of object->refCount++
- nsf.c: fix small memory leak for nsf::is in error cases
- renamed converter from "mixinspec" to "mixinreg"

- Use mixinregObjType as well in NsfRelationCmd(), so this is the only
  place, where mixin and guards are processed.
- Since the type converter converts Tcl-Objs, we have less context
  information (e.g. we have no base class, on which we can decide to
  call e.g. __unknown on on of the objects systems).  - because of the
  point above, i removed ::xotcl::Class->__unknown and
  ::nx::Class->__unknown in favor of a global proc ::nsf::unknown, for
  which unknown handlers can be registered
- GetClassFromObj() receives as last argument "withUnknown" instead of
  baseClass to indicate, when unknown should be tried.
- new function NsfCallUnknownHandler()

- moved mixin reg type converter to a new file (nsfObj.c)
- added NsfFilterregObjType, to provide a converter for filter
  registration similar to mixin registrations
- replaced dummy dupIntRepProc and updateStringProc in nsfObj.c by NULL

- fixed memory leak in "... info mixin classes -heritage"
- added tests for integer, wideinteger and bignums

- added value checker type int32 (similar to "string is integer") and
  changed value checker "integer" to accept all integers

- library/mongodb:
   * use type int32
   * updated to new nx/nsf interfaces
   * updated for mongo-c-driver post 0.3
     (supporting result MONGO_OK for mongo_cursor_next)
   * factored out "mongo cond" from "mongo query"

- fixing part of the memory leak introduced for bignum handling above
  (for some unknown reasons, we see crashes from mp_clear)
- extend regression test

- improve bignum conversion handling further
- found memory leak in tcl

- provided nicer registration and inspection interface for unknown handlers
- added documentation for unknown handlers in tutorial
- cleanup of __unknown

- added handling for provided arguments to positional object parameters with
  disposition alias and forward
- provided better error messages for unknown parameter options

    data) and how to retrieve this via the gridfile interface

- nsf.c:
   * report only fully initialized slot objects via "info slots" to
     avoid chicken-egg problem during method "objectparameter"
   * added flag -array to ::nsf::var::exists to check, whether
     the variable is an array (to avoid "o eval {array exists ...}"

     versions in the argument vector of scripted methods
     (found via INCR_REF_COUNT2/DECR_REF_COUNT2)

- nsf.c:

  of copy is omitted, the copied object is created with a fresh
  name (i.e. created with the method "new"). Example
     set x [o copy]

- nx.tcl:
  * added protected and public for "require method"

    function mongo_parse_host()
  * updated error codes according to git head

- nsf.c:
  added cmd __db_compile_epoch for compile-epoch introspection

- Mystery solved, why in the script below the interp>compileEpoch is
  incremented, when D is redefined, but in other cases not.  In the
  script below the method D.init is compiled by tcl, since it has a
  trivial body. Therefore, a redefinition of D will remove this
  compiled body and all its potential usages. Therefore the
  interp->epoch is incremented. If the body is e.g.  "return", the
  epoch is not incremented (observed with Tcl 8.5.10)

=================================================

- nsf.c:
  * enabled MEM_COUNT debugging for multi-threaded
    apps. We collect the MEM_COUNT statistics now

    "interp" in case where alloc() and free()
    or refCount functions are used (textually,
    a big change)

  - added experimental parameter option noleadingdash
  - additional regression test file method-parameter.test
  - provide selective error messages for unknown nonpos args

nsf.c:
  - reform of method lookup. new code uses

      (provide shell calls and, targets and dependencies)
    * provided a different flag for the generation of the documentation
      (-develop, .... or -final) to show/hide it.
   * separated entries for methods and hooks (can't be called if not defined)?
    hooks:
      * recreate should only be called internally, similarly "init" etc.
      * __unknown
    unknown is a hook for Object but a method for Class

- fixed strange ref-counting bug in 8.6b2 bug-is-86.tcl
   where 2 ref-counted items are not freed (value:class,
   issued from nx.tcl around line 120). Compile with DEBUG86B2
   for more info
     =================================================
     # -*- Tcl -*-
     package req nx
     package require nx::test

     nx::Test case ensemble-next-with-colon-prefix {
       nx::Object create obj {
	 :public method foo {} { return [:info class] }

	 :method info {} {;}
       }
       ? {obj foo} {wrong # args: should be ":info"}
     }
     =================================================

- nsf.c: cleanup on DEBUG86B2

- nx.tcl:
  * do not namespace import my into ::nx
  * replace usages of "my" by colon invocations

- doc:
  * extended method resolution section
  * documented invocation flags for colon

- nsf.c:
  * add flags "-closure" and "-source" to "/cls/ info methods"
    (the cases for "/obj/ info methods" are already covered by
    "/obj/ info lookup methods")
  * extend regression test

- nx-traits:
  * use "info methods -closure" instead of instantiating a
    class at trait-insertion time
  * added trait as package nx::callback

- example scripts: added tk-mini and tk-horse-race

- make "/object/ require" an ensemble method
- traits: renamed "useTrait" into "require trait"

- added per-object traits (and per-class-object traits)
- added tk-spread and tk-locomotive to example scripts

- altered default handling to honor side effects of aliased object
  parameters. This slows down evaluation a little. Side-effects from
  aliased parameters are discouraged, since the order of the
  evaluation should not matter of an declarative evaluation of the
  argument vector.
- extended regression test

- library/mongo:
  * updated interface to current nx
  * updated to mongo-c-driver 0.4 (current version)
  * The mongo c-driver does not allow to add DBRefs, since
    it refuses to accept field names with leading '$'. So we skip these
    tests for the time being.

-nsf.c:
  - remove quadratic behavior when adding many classes (10 thousands)
  - deletion is still for huge number of classes quite slow.

- nx.tcl, xotcl.tcl:
  * remove proc "register_system_slots" since 'rename
    register_system_slots ""' fails on aolserver
  * bump version number to 2.0b1

- nsf.c: extended "new":
  * nonpos-arg "-childof" accepts now a namespace
    (required an object before). Therefore, one can
    use now "... new -childof [namespace current]",
    even when the current namespace is not an object

- nx.tcl: simplified ::nx::ScopedNew to ::nx::NsScopedNew:
  before it was necessary to create a new volatile class for every
  invocation of contains.
- extended regression test

- nx.tcl: don't use mixins in method "contains", but remap the new
  implementation. If there are ten thousands of classes defined,
  adding mixins to the root meta-class degrades linearly on the number
  of classes defined (the mixin paths for all classes must be
  invalidated). This might be a problem for frequent "contains"
  invocations.
- bump version numbers for nx, xotcl2 and nsf to 2.0b2

- rename "info method handle /methodName/" into
         "info method registrationhandle /methodName/"
- rename "info method origin /methodName/" into
         "info method definitionhandle /methodName/"

- added "info method handle" as short form of "info method definitionhandle"
- added "info method origin" to return the target of an alias (or empty)

- update migration guide and tutorial
- cleanup "//" in sources

nsf.c:
- adding method epoch incr to NsfAddObjectMethod() and NsfAddClassMethod()
- added function CmdListAddSorted() to improve mixinof management

serializer.tcl:
- Use directdispatch to query existing traces without the need
  of an extra method. By this change, the serializer works in
  constant time independent on the number of existing objects.

nsf.c:
- reduce number of RUNTIME_STATE(interp) in favor of a variable.
- make time of the definition of a method independent on the
  number of defined instances (unless, when filters are defined)

nsf.c:
- fixed bug with recursive aliases
- extended regression test

- updated and shorted README.aol and TODO
- removed the following files from the repository.
      deleted:    COMPILE
      deleted:    COMPILE.win
      deleted:    ChangeLog
      deleted:    unix/xotcl.spec.in
      deleted:    win/Makefile.vc
  These files should be probably added again at some later time,
  but need some rework. Old versions are still available from the
  2.0.0-develop branch

- Replaced hash-table for GetAllInstances() with a linear list.
  As a result, mass-destroy on exit is now much faster. Valgrind
  reports that the full circle of creating 100.000 objects and
  destroying it on exit became about 15% faster.
- added additional argument adEnd to CmdListAdd()
- renamed CmdListRemoveList() to CmdListFree()
- improved code documentation
- removed unneeded AddInstance() and RemoveInstance()
- deactivated uncalled ReverseLookupCmdFromCmdTable() and
  GetHiddenObjectFromCmd() since apparently not needed any more

nsf.c:
- removed conditionals in AddInstance() and RemoveInstance()
- dropped result from RemoveInstance()

nsf.c:
- added method NsfMethodNamePath() to compute the ensemble path
  in error messages
- reduce verbosity
- extended regression test

- nsf.c: fix call of DispatchDefaultMethod() in cases it triggers an error for 8.6b
- nx.tcl: give a slightly better error message in case the root-object of an ensemble is called directly

nsf.c:
- handle duplicates in the cmd-list during cleanup
- Avoid duplicate entries in instance lists for diamond inheritance by
  maintaining the set of already processed entries in
  NsfClassInfoInstancesMethod1() and GetAllInstances().
- extended regression test
- removed "namespace import" in object-system test

nsf.c:
- Reform of subclass/superclass handling.
  * unifying transitive subclass handling
  * localizing and documenting caching of subclass/superclass lists
  * eliminating repetitious computation of subclass lists
  * re-factored code, renamed some functions to better reflect their purpose
  * improved documentation
- fixed a potential crash for class deletion triggering implicit deletions
  further deletions referencing the parent class
- extended regression test

nsf.c, nsf.h, nsfStack.c, nx.tcl, tcl-cool.tcl, xotcl2.tcl
- fix spelling in comments
- strip unneeded space
- fixed potential crash when generating error message about argument usage
  when called without a call-stack
- added regression test

nsf.c:
- change argument of IsMetaClass() to type *NsfObject
- provide basic protection against most likely unintended
  deletion/overwriting of base classes.
- extend regression test

- fix typos
- extend regression test to improve coverage
- improve branch prediction

- simplify macro handling with __WIN32__
- regroup some macro definitions

- "info method": missing an option to return the "-returns
  specification". Also: "-returns" spec is not included in "info
  method definition".

- simplified usage of ObjectName() and ClassName() macros (no caller parenthesis needed)
- added experimental object property keepcallerself (currently only evaluated by aliased objects)
- removed TODOs from keepcallerself in destroy.test; calls were truly recursive,
  behavior was correct.

- Added experimental object property "allowmethoddispatch" for
  child-objects to be called from parent objects via method interface.
  Background: both, per-object methods and child objects are
  implemented via cmds in the same tcl namespace. Without special
  care, both are callable via the standard dispatch. Apparently, this
  is not always wanted.
- handled allowmethoddispatch and keepcallerself in copy/move
- set allowmethoddispatch per-default in XOTcl
- removed visibility of objects with "allowmethoddispatch" false in
  "info methods" and "info search methods"
- extended regression test

- improve handling of multiple error messages in a single command

- alias reform: instead of calling first an alias with a stack frame
  followed by the dispatched of the aliased cmd, resolve aliases
  internally in dispatch. This has the advantage that we do not
  have to ignore the "transparent" stack frame in some situations,
  and we have much less problems with the names of the aliased cmds
  (e.g. objects) in the introspection methods. Additionally, several
  problem cases disappeared from the regression test cases.
  In addition, the new approach is faster.
- eliminating obsolete flag NSF_CSC_CALL_IS_TRANSPARENT

- use alias-stubs for aliases pointing to objects. This allows
  us to distinguish between cases, where an object is dispatch-able
  due to the alias or due to allowmethoddispatch (when the object
  happens to be a subobject and has therefore its cmd in the same
  namespace). The semantics are now:
   - aliases to objects are always dispatch-able, no matter, how
     allowmethoddispatch is set.
   - direct sub-objects of objects are currently on dispatch-able
     when allowmethoddispatch is set. Note, that this could
     be seen as a method-property of the method-name, which
     could be made "private" as well to avoid such direct dispatches.

- nsf.c: start all error messages with a lower case word for consistency
  and to follow closer to Tcl's conventions

- deactivate for the time being allowmethoddispatch
  (make it behave always like true)
- added instead new flag "perobjectdispatch" to make
  behavior of ensemble objects configurable.
- The behavior for keepcallerself is currently
  only activated for the method-interface
  for object dispatch, since otherwise the following
  would be dangerous, since "o2 foo" would destroy o2
     nx::Object create o1
     nsf::object::property o1 keepcallerself true
     nx::Object create o2 {
       ::public method foo {} {o1 destroy}
     }
     o2 foo

- fixed potential crash from method caching, when permissions on cmds are
  changed and become e.g. unresolvable
- removed flag allowmethoddispatch, since behavior can be archived via
  private flag.
- extended regression test

- extend regression test for interactions between "keepcallerself" and
  "perobjectdispatch"
- some minor cleanup

- fixed NRE memory management (for Tcl 8.6) by refactoring
  alias handling

- removed documentation about incompatibility to XOTcl1 in
  respect of the method interface for object invocations
- doc fixed line-number handling locally

- changed object->flags from "unsigned short" to "unsigned int"
- reintroduced NSF_TCL_DELETE to address bug flagged from memdebug
- extended regression test

- Cleanup for compilation under MSC
  (avoid unsupported forward declaration of array)
- further documentation of functions, better grouping of functions
- use fixed array size for method_definitions for MSC
- Don't export symbols in the general case just because of MSC/C89 compliance

- Forward setting of object parameters to the slot object, when assign
  method is user-defined on the slot object
- Cleanup and extend regression test

- additional object parameter option "invokesetter" managed by nx.tcl
  This was necessary, since the previously implemented strategy
  called the setter whenever slot= was provided. This has the problem,
  that values could be converted twice (once by "configure", once
  by the setter method", which lead for the converter to a double
  refcounting on the value.

- use Tcl's EXTERN macro instead of "extern"
- treating incompatible forwarding to slot vs. slot option noaccessor
- extended regression test

- don't allow object creation to overwrite non-object cmds (e.g. procs)
- don't allow method to overwrite child object
- extended regression test
- documented cmd overwrite protection feature as incompatibility with XOTcl 1
- documented dependencies between configure flags and feature activation cpp macros

nsf.c:
- Fixed a bad interaction between Tcl's apply (pushing lambda frames)
  and the variable resolvers. The variable resolver was not able to
  resolve variables, while the command resolver was still working
  correctly.
- Extended regression test

nsf.c:
- added object parameter option "slotinitialize"
- renamed object parameter option "invokesetter" -> "slotassign"
- call slot.assign instead of setter of object
- removed restriction on nosetter/invokesetter: nosetter can
  be used in connection with slotassign
- added regression test for slot.initialize

nsf.c:
- pass property name to slot "initialize" method to conform
  with the interface to "assign", "get" ... (all these receive
  the property name as well)
- allow slot "initialize" method to be protected
  (handled similarly to "init")

- extended regression tests for yield
- implemented "next" for ruby-like enumerators (each needs still more work)

- tcl86.test: better implementation of method "each",
  cleanup and extension of enumerator tests

- fix compilation when compiled without threads (many thanks for
  r.zaumseil for noting this).
- protect serial generation for parameters via mutex

- added compile macro NSF_STACKCHECK to provide stack monitoring/debugging
  (especially useful for multi threaded programs, where stack
  is more limited)
- make ::nsf::log more robust for aolserver/naviserver, since ::ns_log is
  not always around when an output is needed

- serializer:
  * make [::Serializer deepSerialize -ignoreVarsRE "" $o] behave like
    [::Serializer deepSerialize $o], since learn@wu depends on that, and
    a value for ignoreVarsRE of empty looks more like an omitted value than
    a regular expression, that should match everything.
  * extended regression test

nsf.c:
- generalize stack monitor by handling growing and shrinking stacks
- refactor into function CheckCStack()

- serializer:
  * pertain perobjectdispatch and keepcallerself in serializer
  * extend regression test

nsf.c:
- refactor ObjectCmdMethodDispatch() for clarity
- prepare work on object method dispatches with
  KEEP_CALLER_SELF and no NSF_PER_OBJECT_DISPATCH

- explorative implementation of object method dispatches with
  KEEP_CALLER_SELF and no NSF_PER_OBJECT_DISPATCH
- extend regression test

nsf.c:
- implement escaping for comma in value of parameter options:
  escaping in values can be achieved via duplicating the comma.
  In the following example is the value for arg "1,3"
    D public method foo {a:commaRange,arg=1,,3,optional} {..}
  Escaping via \ would actually require 4 backslashes
  due to Tcl's escaping rules (two, to get a single backslash,
  another two due to list-splitting to obtain default from arg).
- extend regression test

nsf.c:
- allow parens in property names (array syntax)
- added "/obj/ info name" (as alternative to "namespace tail [self]")

nx.tcl:
- added "private property foo"
- extended regression test
- start error messages with a lower case word for consistency
  and to follow closer to Tcl's conventions

Documentation:
- added design study ruby-mixins.tcl to example-docs and regression test
- added documentation for "/obj/ info name" to migration guide and
  .nxd file
- adding more comments to examples in migration guide
- document private properties in tutorial and migration guide
- improve wording in documenting
- extend regression test

nsfShadow.c
- bump MethodEpoch when a tcl ::rename command happens
  on a nsf method (which might be cached in a Tcl_Obj)
  This fixes a crash reported by Arthur Schreiber
nsf.c:
- make NsfInstanceMethodEpochIncr() and NsfObjectMethodEpochIncr()
  accessible from all files using nsfInt.h
- remove experimental code (backslash escaping for "," in parameter
  option parse

nsf.c:
- added a SlotContainerCmdResolver() to avoid interaction of slot
  names with names of callable tcl commands. Without the
  SlotContainerCmdResolver() the call to "list" in a property named
  "list" leads to a call to the container object ::Test2::slot::list
  instead to the intended ::list. The implementation is not perfect,
  since it ignores the namespace path inside the slot container.
- added regression test.

nsf.c:
- ignore in internal calls to "dealloc" protection settings
- handle cyclical class dependencies during object system finalize
- extend regression test

nsf.c:
- handle cyclical superclassclass dependencies during object system finalize
- extend regression test

nx.tcl:
- set multiplicity for mixins and filters by default from 1..n to 0..n
  to avoid error messages, when e.g. empty mixin lists are configured.
  Setting empty mixin-lists is strictly speaking not necessary,
  but this eases the code in cases the lists are sometimes empty.

nx::test:
- added summary at the end of "make test" via log file
- updated .gitignore

nsf.c
- rename nx::Object.configure to nx::Object.__configure
  to free method name "configure" for an e.g. tk-like configure
- refactored code to allow to parameterize handling of required flag for parameters
- don't flag an error when configure is called on an initialized object
  (logic: if the object is initialized, configure must have been called
   before, and the required action must have been already taken).

nx.tcl:
- rename the following internally called methods (not for XOTcl).
     alloc -> __alloc
     dealloc -> __dealloc
     objectparameter -> __objectparameter
     recreate -> __recreate
- from these methods, only __objectparameter is defined per default,
  the others are defined on demand

- updated 34 copyright notices

nsf.c:
- extended nsf::method::delete to handle ensemble names

nx.tcl:
- added tk/incr-tcl style cget methods on class/object levels as
  ensemble methods.
- improve copy handling with other child-types of the slot container working
- make sure to ignore non-slot-type objects in slot introspection
- worked on regression test until "methods.test". others are missing,
  but maybe reconsideration

nsf.c:
- implemented cget as a configure-like method, dropped ensemble method variant

nx.tcl:
- simplified "/obj|cls/ delete method" due to resolving capabilities in
  nsf::delete::method

xotcl2.tcl:
- made destructor of Connection more robust such it does not depend on
  accessor methods.

- fixed regression test to run all test again correctly

nsf.c:
- made argument of cget required

nx.tcl:
- added Tk-style methods "configure" and "cget"
- added additional regression test set for cget and configure

- renamed testlog file, remove it on "make clean"

nx.tcl:
- remove debugging output

nsf.c:
- fixed parmeter syntax for required nonpos args
- deactivate deletion of methods via nsf::object::delete
  during shutdown to avoid missing slot forwarders called from
  destructors

nx::Class create C {
    :property {b b1}
    :public property {c c1}
    :protected property -accessor {d d1}

    :variable foo
}

Property reform part 1:

- disallow protection modifiers for "properties" and
  add new flag "-accessor" to "property" and "variable"
  This changes definitions like
     Class create C {
       :property {a a1}
       :public property {b b1}
       :protected property {c c1}
       :private property {d d1}
     }
   to
     Class create C {
       :property {a a1}
       :property -accessor public {b b1}
       :property -accessor protected {c c1}
       :property -accessor private {d d1}
     }
   since "properties" are always public accessible
   over the "configure" and "cget" interface, but the
   accessors methods might not be public. The value of
   the accessor might be also "none" (specifying explicitly
   that no accessor is wanted) or "", which means: use the default.
   Same holds for "variable"

- disallow parameter option "incremental" and change it to a flag
  of the property or variable. The motivation for this is due to
  the fact, that "incremental" is a property of the accessor, and
  not of the value.

  old:
     Class create C {
       :property foo:int,incremental
       :variable bar:int,incremental
     }

  new:
     Class create C {
       :property -incremental foo:int
       :variable -incremental bar:int
     }

- disallow "public class property" and friends since these are not needed
- removed parameter property "noaccessor"

- removed "nx::configure defaultPropertyCallProtection" and
  method hook "__default_property_call_protection"

- introduced "nx::configure defaultAccessor" and
  method hook "__default_accessor"

- for the time being, "defaultAccessor" is "public" for NX and XOTcl,
  will be changed to "none" in NX

- extended regression test (new file properties.test)


Property Reform Part 2: better handling of per-object properties
nsf.c:
- changed "/class/ __objectconfigure" to "/obj/ __objectconfigure"
  to be able to handle per-object properties on classes properly.
- renamed "info method parametersyntax" -> "info method syntax"
- renamed "/obj|cls/ info method parametersyntax" into "/obj|cls/ info method syntax"
- replaced "::nsf::methods::class::info::objectparameter" by
  "::nsf::methods::object::info::objectparameter"
- new command "::nsf::parameter::specs ?-configure? ?-noposargs? slotobjs":
  convert provided slotobjs into a list of parameter specs
- new command "::nsf::parameter::get list|name|syntax parameterspec":
  convert parameter spec into syntax form, or retrieve pieces of
  information from it (can be extended in the future)
- added more or less generic list handling functions TclObjListFreeList(), TclObjListNewElement()
  and TclObjListAdd() used by "::nsf::parameter::specs"
- replaced "::nsf::method::property /obj/ -per-object /name/ slotcontainer ?value?"
  by "::nsf::object::property /obj/ slotcontainer ?value?"
- added "::nsf::object::property /obj/ hasperobjectslots ?value?"

nx.tcl:
- new info methods
  * "/obj/ info lookup parameter definitions"
  * "/obj/ info lookup parameter names"
  * "/obj/ info lookup parameter list"
  * "/obj/ info lookup parameter syntax"
- changed "/cls/ info parameter definition ?name?"
  into "/cls/ info parameter definitions ?name?"
  since ir returns a list. Still, "list" or "syntax" won't
  be plural

XOTcl 2
- don't blindly register all object/class methods for XOTcl

nsf.c:
- fix potential bad interaction between per-object mixins and
  per-class caching of object-parameters
- first draft of per-object parameter caching (for
  per-object-mixins and  per-object properties).


nsf.c:
- rename invalidateobjectparameter    -> parameter:invalidate::classcache
- rename invalidateobjobjectparameter -> parameter:invalidate::objectcache
- bring cmds into alphabetical order

- NsfObjInfoObjectparameterMethod(): return not only the first matching
  parameter, but the list of all matching ones. The last optional
  argument was renamed from "name" to "pattern" accordingly

- invalidation of per-object parameter cache
  * on mixin changes and
  * on deletion/adding of per-object slots
- activate PER_OBJECT_PARAMETER_CACHING per default
  (flipping this parameter makes regression test more than 20 faster).
- extended regression test

nsf.c
- added functionality for "cget" to call parameter-methods
  (e.g. "... cget -class"). The method cget calls either
  "/slot/ get ..." (when slot=... is provided in the parameter spec)
  or it assumes that the method without argument returns the value
- added "::nsf::object::property /obj/ volatile" to query
  whether a object is volatile or not
- "/obj/ cget -volatile" returns now the volatile state of the object
- factored out ParameterMethodDispatch() from OConfigureMethod()
- extended regression test

nx.tcl:
- change parameter name in "/cls/ info parameter ... ?pattern?"
  from "name" to "pattern"
- changed name "/obj|cls/ slot info definition" to
  "/obj|cls/ slot info definition" since result is a set
- dropped parameter method "properties"
- dropped "/obj/ info properties"
  (since "properties" or "variables" are returned")
- extended regression test

nsf.c:
- factored out ParameterMethodForwardDispatch() to
  call a parameter method defined as a forwarder
  the same way from "configure" and "cget"
- extended regression test

nx.tcl:
- property has now a boolean non-positional argument "-config"
  /obj|cls/ property ?-accessor value? ?-config boolean? ?-incremental? ?-class value? spec ?initblock?
  in symmetry with "-accessor" (parameter option "noconfig" is still needed
  to flag nsf for variables that should be initialized, which are
  not configurable
- "/obj|cls/ info slot definitions" returns a full command
  (containing flags and property|variable)
- extended regression test

nsf.c:
- handling of method names in error messages from nsfAPI.h. Make sure
  that error message is generated with the actual method name.

Object-method Reform:
- changed interface to object specific commands by requiring an
  ensemble named "object". The rational behind is essentially
  to use always the same info command to retrieve object
  specific methods, no matter whether these are defined
  on a plain object or an a class object (does not break
  the "contract" what e.g. "info method" returns).

 Now we define methods via:

   /cls/ method foo {args} {...body...}
   /cls/ object method foo {args} {...body...}
   /obj/ object method foo {args} {...body...}

 Similarly, aliases, forwards and mixins are defined, e.g.

   /cls/ mixin add ...
   /cls/ object mixin add ...
   /obj/ object mixin add ...
   /obj/ require object method ...
   /obj/ object property ...
   /obj/ object variable ...

 The same change propagated as well to the "info" method.
 Now we have:

   /cls/ info methods ...
   /cls/ info object methods ...
   /obj/ info object methods ...

 Similar, the object parametererization uses
   /cls/ create obj -object-mixin M
   /cls/ create obj -object-filter f
   /metacls/ create cls -mixin M1 -object-mixin M2
   /metacls/ create cls -filter f1 -object-filter f2

- as a consequence,
  a) "/cls/ class method ..."
     "/cls/ class alias ..."
     "/cls/ class forward ..."
     "/cls/ class filter ..."
     "/cls/ class filterguard ..."
     "/cls/ class mixin ..."
     "/cls/ class mixinguard ..."
     "/cls/ class info ..."
     "/obj/ class method require method ..."
     "/obj/ class method require public method ..."
     "/obj/ class method require protected method ..."
     "/obj/ class method require private method ..."
     "/cls/ class property ..."
     "/cls/ class variable ..."
     "/cls/ class delete property ..."
     "/cls/ class delete variable ..."
     "/cls/ class delete method ..."
     "/cls/ require class method ..."
     "/cls/ require public class method ..."
     "/cls/ require protected class method ..."
     "/cls/ require private class method ..."

    were dropped

  b) "/obj/ method ...."
     "/obj/ alias ...."
     "/obj/ forward ...."
     "/obj/ filter ...."
     "/obj/ mixin ...."
     "/obj/ info method*"
     "/cls/ create obj -mixin M"
     "/cls/ create obj -filter f"
     "/obj/ require method ..."
     "/obj/ require public method ..."
     "/obj/ require protected method ..."
     "/obj/ require private method ..."
     were dropped

- added package nx::class-method to allow optionally the "class" notation
  "/cls/ class method ..." (and friends, see (a)), and
  "/cls/ class info ...

- added package nx::plain-object-method to allow optionally plain method
  b) "/obj/ method ...." (and friends, see (b))

- added support to slots to use ensemble methods as setters
- added "/obj/ object variable" and "/obj/ object property"

- bumped version number to 2.0b5
- tested with NaviServer and OpenACS
  (new version of nx needs as well a newest NaviServer,
  since ns_cache implementation needs to be objectified;
  newest NaviServer version works as well with older nx)

- moved "/obj/ info slot definition|..." to
  "/obj/ info object slot definition|..." for consistency
- provided "parametersyntax()" for "object mixin" and "object filter"


Method and configure parameter reform:
- unify handling / naming / parameterization of method parameters and
  configure parameters

- New Interface:

     /cls/ info configure parameters ?pattern? -> list of params
     /cls/ info configure syntax -> syntax output

     /obj/ info method parameters /methodName/ ?/pattern/? -> list of params
     /obj/ info method syntax -> syntax output

     /obj/ info lookup configure parameters ?/pattern/? -> list of params
     /obj/ info lookup configure syntax -> syntax output

     /cls/ info parameter list|name|syntax /param/ -> value

   "... method syntax" and "... configure syntax" return the full method/configure call,
  and not only the parameters as in previous versions. Therefore, providing a pattern
  could lead to unexpected results, therefore the argument was dropped.

- Replacements relative to 2.0b4:

   {/cls/ info parameter definitions}      -> {/cls/ info configure parameters}
   {/cls/ info parameter definitions x}    -> {/cls/ info configure parameters x}
   {/cls/ info parameter syntax ?pattern?} -> {/cls/ info configure syntax}
   {/obj/ info lookup parameter definitions ?pattern?} -> {/obj/ info lookup configure parameters ?pattern?}
   {/obj/ info lookup parameter syntax ?pattern?} -> {/obj/ info lookup configure syntax}

- Dropped calls:

  /cls/ info parameter list ?/pattern/?
  /cls/ info parameter names ?/pattern/?

  syntax of a single parameter via this interface
  /cls/ info configure syntax ?/pattern/?

  /obj/ info lookup parameter names ?/pattern/?
  /obj/ info lookup parameter list ?/pattern/?


Method and configure parameter reform, Part 2:
In order to streamline the interface further, we tried to follow the idea to use
"... info /plural word/" to obtain a set of handles, and then a separate call
to obtain the details. Therefore, we replaced

    /cls/ info slot objects
    /cls/ info slot definitions
    /cls/ info slot names

    /obj/ info object slot objects
    /obj/ info object slot definitions
    /obj/ info object slot names

    /obj/ info lookup slots

by

   /cls/ info slots             ?-type /type/? ?-closure? ?-source all|application|baseclasses? ?/pattern/?
   /obj/ info object slots      ?-type /type/? ?/pattern/?
   /obj/ info lookup slots      ?-type /type/? ?-source all|application|baseclasses? ?/pattern/?

- nx.tcl: handle "incremental" in slot reconfigure
- nx.tcl: change defaultAccessor to "none"

- dropped "/obj/ info slot definition /slotobj/" in favor of "/slotobj/ definition"



Method and configure parameter reform, Part 3:
- added

    /obj/ info lookup variables                  -> list of handles
    /obj/ info lookup object variables           -> list of handles
    /obj/ info variable definition|name|parameter /handle/

- nx.tcl: added forward compatible scripted implementation of "lmap"

- nsf.c: handle names for private slots in pattern provided to AddSlotObjects(),
  used e.g. in "info lookup slots /pattern/"
- added new regression test info-variables.test

- nx-pp.tcl: fixed changed accessor handling, added cget to highlight words
- updated next-migration guide to reflect changes from the configure reform

- "info method syntax" returns now "/cls/ ...."
- "info object method syntax" returns now "/obj/ ...."

- hopefully the last changes for ?object? method|variable|property:
  defined
   * "/obj/ delete object method"
   * "/obj/ delete object property"
   * "/obj/ delete object variable"

- extended parameter extractor: new functionality
    ::nsf::parameter get default /parameter/ ?/varname/?
    ::nsf::parameter get type /parameter/
    /obj/ info parameter get default /parameter/ ?/varname/?
    /obj/ info parameter get type /parameter/

- nsf.c: handle full-qualified name for private slots (AddSlotObjects())
- extended regression test

- C-code Generator: added "-typeName" for enumeration types that
  allows for disambiguation of enumerations with different argument
  names.  Before that, the argument name determined the c-type of the
  enumeration.  Therefore it was not possible to use argName "-type"
  for two different functions with a different list of enumerators.

- changed "-methodtype" to simply "-type" in
    /obj/ info methods ... ?-type all|scripted|builtin|alias|forwarder|object|setter|nsfproc? ...
    /obj/ info object methods ... ?-type all|scripted|builtin|alias|forwarder|object|setter|nsfproc? ...
    /obj/ info lookup methods ... ?-type all|scripted|builtin|alias|forwarder|object|setter|nsfproc? ...

- removed some TODOs from tests/parameters.test

- parameter dispositions:
  We differentiate now between "initcmd" and "cmd": an "initcmd" is only
  evaluated once, but one can provide configure values for this parameter
  later. a "cmd" is executed on every evaluation, it is only possible
  to pass cmds to it. The trailing argument of the configure parameters
  (used e.g. for scripted object/class definitions) is now of type "cmd".
  Implementation not yet complete (object cases are not correct).

- nsf.c: fix crash when "nsf::my" is called with a single
  argument outside the object context.

- fixed cases, where valuechangedcmd (and the other traces) did not
  work with "configure" method. When slot traces are used, it cleans
  other traces for the same operations.
- extended regression test

- added implementation for slots with traces+types for classes
- exception for incorrect defaults are thrown during slot creation
- extended nsf::is, added parameter
   * ?-configure? -- accept configure parameter options
   * ?-name /name/? -- provide a parameter name for error message
- simplified nx.tcl by using new nsf::is
- extended regression test

- changed ::nsf::parametersyntax(..) to ::nsf::parameter::syntax(..)
- xotcl2: adjusted manual parameter syntax entries to new conventions

Cleanup of nsfAPI.decls
- remove unneeded enumeration types
- use "typeName" to shorten reported names of parameters
- use camel case for reported names

Traits:
- changed from traits-as-objects to traits-as-classes. This
  allows for higher orthogonality of traits and class definitions
  and allows in principle traits for object-specific methods
  (not fully implemented/tested)
- fixed property/variable inheritance in traits.

nsf.c:
- changed enumeration values for "-source" in
     "info lookup methods"
     "info lookup slots"
     "info methods"
     "info slots"
  of "all|application|baseclasses"
  to "all|application|system"
  for consistency with "nsf::my" and "nsf::dispatch"
  which uses "-system" as well

nx.tcl:
- removed "info is .." since it might raise more questions than it solves
- renamed initblock parameter from __initcmd to __initblock
- renamed nsf::configure parameter from "keepinitcmds" to "keepcmds"
- saving "keepcmds" in an associative array named "__cmd(/parameternName)"
  to allow saving of multiple parmeters with less name clash danger
  (when application stays away from variables stating with double
  underscore)

- completed coverage if plain-object-method.tcl
- provided warnings via plain-object-method.tcl via "nsf::log warn ..."

nsf.c
- fixed potential infinite loop in pattern matching for precedence lists
- cget: make error message closer to tcl conventions
- extended regression test

package nx::plain-object-method:
- made warnings configurable via
  nx::configure plain-object-method-warning on|off
- completed coverage and test cases

package nx::class-method:
- convenience package similar to nx::plain-object-method
- allow for usage "C class method ..." in addition to
  "C object method".
- made warnings configurable via
  nx::configure class-method-warning on|off
- completed coverage and test cases

nx.tcl:
- replaced functionality of "/obj/ configure" by
  "/obj/ info configure" to re-enable semantics
  of the plain configure method, even when called without
  arguments. "/obj/ info configure" is actually a
  convenience method to allow to write
     o1 info configure
  instead of
     o1 info lookup configure syntax

- traits: added ability to turn on verbosity for traits
  by using
     nx::configure trait-verbosity on|off

nx.tcl:
- renamed variable option "-config" to "-configurable"
  to make its intention clearer

- changed multiplicity of mixin, object-mixin, filter, object-filter
  from 1..n to 0..n; rationale: when one has a list of eg. mixins,
  which should be passed, one has to test for the length before
  passing it, otherwise the empty list would generate an error.
  Allowing 0..n makes the usage simpler and the program shorter.


Removed oboslete item. At least in this concrete form, the
warning does not show up.
- NSF_WITH_VALUE_WARNINGS: Right now, value warnings are also fired
  for arg vectors with a delimiting "--"; right now, this gives a warning:

  Object create o {
  	 :public object method foo {-np1 -np2 p1} {
	     return $p1
	  }
  }

  ? {o foo -np1 1 -np2 2 -- -X} "-X"

nsf.c:
- when creation with an required configure parameter failed,
  delete the half-baked object to avoid confusing states.

- improved handling of required configure parameters
  when classes are changed dynamically.
  When configure parameter are defined required, checking
  for the absence of required parameter was only performed
  at creation time. When objects were re-classed or their
  classes extended with required parameters, later
  calls to configure did not trigger exceptions. Now
  we check for the existence of the instance variable
  which addresses most of these points, but in future
  we might wish a more general solution (see comment
  for futures releases)

nx::test:
- deactivate calling overhead calculation, since this
  is not reliable (sometimes larger than the call).

- Old TODO maybe obsolete:

  handling of recreate (see regression test for class-level properties)

  Could not find references about this in the parameters
  or properties tests.

nsf.m4:
- nsf.m4 currently unused (SC_PATH_NSFCONFIG and SC_LOAD_NSFCONFIG)
  We can delete it from the current version.

nsf.c
- fixed a bug in "info methods returns" in cases, where
  no returns info was available.
- we can "/obj/ copy" now objects/classes containing
  * aliases
  * setter
  * ensemble methods
  * method protections
  Instead of handling cmd copying in NsfNSCopyCmdsCmd,
  it is replaced now by introspection.
- extended regression test

nsf.c
- fixed a potential crash on destroy for objects having a
  wrapper-less alias defined
- removed obsolete function AssertionAppendPrePost()
- removed obsolete function NsfNSCopyCmdsCmd()
  and ::nsf::nscopycmd (handled now more general on
  scripting level in the "copy" method)

nx.tcl:
- "copy" method: fixed copying of class-level per-object methods
- extended regression tests

serializer.tcl
- added flag -objmap to Serialzer.deepSerialize
  to make serializer usable for copying (-map is to coarse)
- extended regression test

nsf.c:
- Eliminate all use of Tcl_GetStringFromObj() function.

nx::test:
- use the standard configure interface for
  configuring instead of own version
- changed from nx::Test to nx::test
  (user never has to know that nx::Test is a class).
- change test cases to newer interface
- don't use "namespace import nx::*" in test cases
  when not required

nsf.c:
- reduce variable scopes
- fix a bug in SlotContainerCmdResolver() when NSF_MEM_COUNT
  is activated
- fix a small memory leak for PER_OBJECT_PARAMETER_CACHING
- all cases detectable with --enable-memcount=yes are fixed

 - recheck Announce
 - concatenate Changelog
 - update next-scripting doc + examples, pdf-files?
 - build tar etc. as in README.release

nsf.c:
- dont't use the default of a invocation parameter in "configure"
  when the object is already initialized. The default is in
  general only used when the parameter is not specified. We do not want
  e.g. superclass to be reset to ::nx::Object, when configure is
  called on a class without arguments.
- extended regression test

- prepare for providing nx as a tcl module (.tm file).
  this is just a preparation, since for testing, one cannot set up a path
  that prefers a local copy over a global installed one (the global tcl-site is
  preferred over the one specified in e.g. TCL8_5_TM_PATH)

  Moving to tcl modules works in essence via
  git mv library/nx/nx.tcl tcl8/site-tcl/nx-2.0b5.tm

  This is really usable, when
  http://core.tcl.tk/tcl/tktview?name=86ceb4e2b6
  is through

mongodb:
- updated to most recent version of c-driver (0.7.1)
- adapted to nx 2.0b5 (use everywhere cget interface)
- tested with mongodb 2.4.5

- added example scripts rosetta-sudoku.{tcl,html} and tk-ludo.{tcl,html}
- added sample script doc/example-scripts/tk-geo.tcl

mongodb:
- integrated configuration of mongodb into toplevel config file
  option: --with-mongodb=MONGO_INCLUDE_DIR,MONGO_LIB_DIR
- added regression test files for mongodb support
  (low-level (tcl-only) and highlevel (nx based oo support))
- integrated mongodb-testfiles with "make test"
- reduced verbosity of nx-mongo.tcl (added verbosity variable)

nsf.c
- don't call postcondition, when the command/invariant have returned already an error
- fixed a bug where turning on assertions could swallow result-codes
- fix potential crash when preconditions are empty
- extended regression test

serializer
- fix object method serializeExportedMethod: targetName might have been uninitialized

nsf.c
- reduce variable scope
- remove uncalled static function

nsf.c
- fixed a bug where turning on assertions could swallow result-codes
- extended regression test

nsf.c:
- added flag -checkalways to nsf::proc and nsf::asm::proc (for the
  latter just a placeholder for now). If the flag is used, it will cause argument
  testing independently from the "configure checkarguments" setting.
  To force argument checking always is useful e.g. for checking
  external values (e.g. in a web server)
- nsf: added switch "-checkalways" to nsf::method::create
- nx: added switch "checkalways" to "method" and "object method"
- extended regression test

xotcl2:
- fixed "... info defaults ..." and "... info instdefaults ..."
  emulation in XOTcl 2
- fixed error message
- extended regression test
- bumped revision of nsf/xotcl/nx to 2.0b6

gentclAPI.tcl, generic/nsf.decls
- make converter usable from c-based packages compiled with subs activated
- add parameter parser and converter to stub tables

generic/nsfStubLib.c:
- change base stub table from XOTcl to NSF.
- improve wording of error messages.

generic/nsfPointer.c:
- add reference counter to avoid double-inits and double-frees
  in case the table of converters is used from multiple interpreters

generic/nsf.c:
- made linearization monotonic (for multiple inheritance)
  via single-inheritance linearization merging
  while preserving overall linearization rules
- added flag NSF_LINEARIZER_TRACE
- extended regression test

library/lib/make.tcl:
- don't try to load nx when building pkgindex for a binary package (.so or dylib)

mongodb
- upgrade to mongo-c-driver to 0.8.1
- added new flag "-ttl" to mongo::index
- there seems to be now a differen mongo-c-driver to be the preferred
  one, the old one is renamed to mongo-c-driver-legacy
- link against nsf-stublib
- bump version number to 0.2

generic/nsf.c:
- add more assertions
- ensure computation of requires orders for recursive merges

mongodb:
- add flag "-puts" to method "show" of nx::mongo::Class to turnoff
  output to stdout
- handle empty find operations for "find first"
- added method pretty_variables to output available variables
  of a class in a similar style as in the definition
- added low-level method "close" to nx::mongo

nsf.c:
- new command ::nsf::object::alloc /class/ /obj/ ?/script/?
  alloc an object and execute script in the context. Can be
  used to regenerate an object in a old state.

serializer:
- fixed loading of objects with required data in the blueprint
  (many thanks for david hopfmueller for reporting this)
- make use of nsf::object::alloc (1 command instead of 1 create + 2 evals)
- these changes improved loading time of blueprint by about 25%
  for OpenACS+xowiki
- don't rely on the existence of a "trace" method

nsf.c:
- when ::nsf::object::alloc is passed an empty name (2nd argument),
  behave like "new" method

nx:
- allow copy of objects with required arguments
- use ::nsf::object::alloc in "copy" method
- don't depend on method "trace", use directdispatch instead
- remove method "-noinit" (nsf::object::alloc makes it obsolete)
- extend regression test

serializer:
- restore traces after object-serialize

nsf.c:
- fix stub provisioning for Tcl 8.6
- reduce verbosity for FreeUnsetTraceVariable
- return TCL_OK, even when FreeUnsetTraceVariable() fails (warning stays)

nx-mongo:
- implement simple persistent handle management based on per-thread objects

-nsf.c:
- fix bug in interaction between uplevel method and interceptor transparency
- fix bug in interaction between uplevel method from tcl procs
- extend regression test

build-system:
- provide datarootdir to get rid of warning during configure

nx-mongo:
- updated documentation (switch back to mongo-c-driver, but comment usage
  of tagged version v0.8.1)
- added support for rep types (allow for mappings between certain instance
  variables such as arrays or dicts to customizable representations in
  MongoDB)
- added nx-serialize to test cases (simple state persistance for nx objects)
- added nx-rep to test cases (rep types for "array" and "dict")
- improve performance of mongo->tcl conversion by using predefined global strings

nx-monogo:
- Updated the mongo-c-driver and libbson to the actual tip version from github
  (this is a significant change, since 10gen essentially changed the
  officially supported c-driver of MongoDB)
- mongo-c-driver was more or less new-implementation, since structure and
  names changed in the mongo-c-driver substantially, several functions
  were added, several were dropped. The new interface supports now
  e.g. mongo URIs, and should be faster (by using collection objects
  instead of connection handles)
- Although the low-level nsf interface changed significantly, the high level
  (nx level) interface remained unaffected.
- Configure has now --with-mongoc=... and --with-bson instead of --with-mongodb
- New commands:
     mongo::collection::open /mongoConn/ /dbName/ /collectionName/
     mongo::collection::close /collection/
     mongo::gridfs::store_string /content/ /name/ /contentType/
- Make use of the new collection handle
     mongo::count /mongoConn/ /ns/ ...  -> mongo::collection::count /collection/  ...
     mongo::index /mongoConn/ /ns/ ...  -> mongo::collection::index /collection/  ...
     mongo::insert /mongoConn/ /ns/ ... -> mongo::collection::insert /collection/ ...
     mongo::query /mongoConn/ /ns/ ...  -> mongo::collection::query /collection/  ...
     mongo::remove /mongoConn/ /ns/ ... -> mongo::collection::delete /collection/ ...
     mongo::update /mongoConn/ /ns/ ... -> mongo::collection::update /collection/ ...
     mongo::cursor::find /mongoConn/ /ns/ ... -> mongo::cursor::find /collection/ ...
- nsf::mongo::connect receives now a mongoc_uri
  https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-c-driver/blob/master/doc/mongoc_uri.txt
- The gridfs interface allows now to store multiple revisions of a file
- The gridfs interface allows now upload files from a string
- The gridfs interface allows to refer to files by other attributes than
  just the filename (e.g. the mongo id).
- Modified/new gridfile functions
     mongo::gridfile::create ?-source file|string? /gridfs/ /value/ /name/ /contentType/
     mongo::gridfile::delete /gridfs/ /query/
     mongo::gridfile::open /gridfs/ /query/
- Updated README
- Updated regression test
- Added editor hints for a more uniform appearance

nsf.c:
- change name of enumeratorConverterEntry to Nsf_EnumeratorConverterEntry,
  move it with NSF_ARG_* flags to tcl.h to make it available in derived
  modules using the converter
- Added editor hints for a more uniform appearance

nx.tcl:
- raise an error, when an ensemble methods redefined a plain method

nsf.c:
- fix small memory leak in multiple inheritance code.
- all regression tests run cleanly with --enable-memcount=yes
- let [current methodpath] return full path (similar to -path option
  in "info methods"
- handle collateral damage in regression test due to changed result
  of "current methodpath"

nx::traits:
- handle ensemble methods correctly (use full method path for resolution)
- add new regression tests for traits

nx-mongo:
- optional support for mongodb connection pools (compile time macro
  USE_CLIENT_POOL controls this, per default, this is on)
- allow to pass "-metadata" to gridfile::create to ease metadata attachment
  to gridfiles
- some convenience improvements in nx-mongo.tcl (ability to ignore
  attributes in "bson encode", ability to unset attributes in gridfs, ...)
- bump version numbers of nsfmongo to 0.3 and nx-monogo to 0.5
- represent BSON_TYPE_REGEX as pairs (regex + options) in the Tcl
  representation to preserve regular expression options
- update to newest version of mongo-c-driver and libbson from github
- tested with mongodb-c-driver 0.93.0

nx-mongo:
- fixed surprising compiler message
  "alignment of array elements is greater than element size"
  when using e.g. "bson_iter_t i[1]"
- some c-code cleanup
- tested with mongodb-c-driver 0.92.3
- added mongo::collection::stats
- added mongo::cursor::aggregate
- extended regression test

nsf.c:
- fix case, where NsfDStringPrintf() failed (when print llength including
  \0 was 1 byte longer than print buffer)
- make sure, that the list kept for the cached parameter is just built
  from unshared objects; otherwise Tcl append will abort

nx.tcl:
- new package "nx::volatile"
- don't define configure parameter "-volatile" per default;
  use "package req nx::volatile" instead
- don't define per method "volatile" per default;
  use "::nsf::method::require ::nx::Object volatile" instead
- get rid of -volatile in nx.tcl and serializer
- updated/extended regression test

nx-mongo:
- added command "::mongo::status /mongoConn/"
- extended regression test

nsf.c:
- invalidate parameter caches of subclasses on
  NsfParameterInvalidateClassCacheCmd unless during
  shutdown. Otherwise some classes might not become aware of
  properties added later to superclasses.
- extend regression test

nsf.c:
- remove redundant NULL tests
- improve safety mof macro ObjStr()

build-process:
- replace make.tcl by the much simpler mkIndex.tcl:
  * Does not use pkg_mkIndex
  * Does not load binary files (problem for cross compiling)
  * Requires package provide with constant in one line.

small introspection reform:
- Introspection for commands and arguments did not work for
  cmds defined in sub-packages (such as mongodb). We keep
  now this information in hash-tables and maintain a slim
  interface for this.
- fix generation of pkgIndex.tcl for mongodb

Configuration:
- stick closer to TEA conventions (keep tclconfig-sh in tclconfig directory)
- remove obsolete version of install-sh, copy manifested version to
  mongodb library
- fix configure.ac quoting

forwarders:
- RFE "provide %method" as keyword like %proc"
  was already implemented. Dropping %proc would break XOTcl2
  compatibility.
- adding a test case
- use for output of forward ... -verbose NsfLog(...NSF_LOG_NOTICE...)
  instead of fprintf() to make it redirect-able
- use in forwarders "-frame object" instead of "-objframe" in nx
  for consistency with other calls (e.g. dispatch). Other values for
  "-frame" are not allowed. (btw, XOTcl has "-objscope")
- deactivated "-onerror", since its semantics are expressible via
  try/catch, and there are no regression tests for xotcl and nx,
  and we could not find any script that uses this
- renamed "-methodprefix" to "-prefix" in nx, since the prefix
  can be applied as well applied to a cmd.
- use nx rather than xotcl2 terminology in nsf::method::forward

nsf.c:
- de-spaghetti precedence computations for multiple inheritance and
  improve documentation
- get rid of // comments
- use nonnull variable attributes for prototypes (nsf.h, nsfInt.h, nsf.c)
- add returns_nonnull assertion
- simplify few inner code pieces based on assertions
- add several more assertions based on nonnull specifications.
- made nsf::is using the "-strict" option when tcl's "string is" is called.
- let the c-code generator produce as well nonnull assertions
- simplify FilterInvalidateObjOrders() and FilterRemoveDependentFilterCmds()
- simplify SuperclassAdd()
- improve code documentation

nx.tcl:
- Define method "value" as a slot forwarder to allow for calling
  value-less slot methods like e.g. "get" despite of the arity-based
  forward dispatcher.
- extend regression test
- added more test cases for multiplicity and incremental
- preserve lower bound of multiplicity when incremental is added
- added log-level Info which prints always, e.g. for "-verbose" flag
  of forwarder


nsf.c:
    - add flag "-onerror" to nsf::forward::method to handle errors during
      dispatch of a forwarder (not all error messages of forwarder are
      already transformed)
    - added log-level Info which prints always, e.g. for "-verbose" flag
      of forwarder
    - drop setter-rule from properties (use always forwarder)
    - drop "/obj/ /prop/" and  "/obj/ /prop/ /value/" in favor of
      "/obj/ /prop/ get" and  "/obj/ /prop/ set /value/"
      to achieve better orthogonality with e.g. incremental properties
    - allow parameter option "method=" for slotassign as well. rationale:
      this allows to use the parameter "forwardername" to specify a
      different forwarder target method (e.g. in case of object-mixins).
      The method is used both in "configure" and "cget".
    - allow methodname to consist of max two words in relation slots
       (e.g. "-methodname {mixin set}"}
    - allow configuration of internally called "slot.get" and
      "slot.assign" methods via objectsystem::create
    - rename default slot methods add/get to value=add/value=get
    - provide an error message, when referring to a non-existing slot object
    - added likely/unlikely to result == TCL_OK etc.
    - fix one more subtle case of an error being swallowed: for xotcl, the
      constructor returns the list of residual arguments. In case there
      was an error, it was possible that the returned residual arguments
      overwrote the error message in the interp result
    - finish implementation of NsfForwardPrintError()
    - use NsfForwardPrintError() in ForwardArg() for all error messages


nx.tcl:
    - replace empty-named arrays by dicts
    - remove setter methods from BootstrapVariableSlots
    - reducing interface of BootstrapVariableSlots by setting methods protected
    - use value=* as names for internally called and forwarder-called
      accessor methods
    - enforce using "set" for filter/object-filter in slot operations
      (same as for mixins)
    - add "set" as a method name for relation slots
    - implemented relation slot "mixin" and "object-mixin" via "slotassign" to disallow
       "/obj/ mixin /value/" and  "/obj/ object mixin /value/" to use  instead
       "/obj/ mixin set /value/" and  "/obj/ object mixin set /value/"
       while keeping "configure" and "cget" working.
       This has the advantage that  "/obj/ mixin set"  does not try
       to replace the mixin chain by "set"
    - disallow "assign" for nx::variableSlots
    - use set/get/add as slot methods for get/configure/incremental
      operations
    - de-mangle slots for nx/xotcl2 further
    - enforce usage of "get" for all slots in nx
    - put test cases for all kind of mix setter / getter together in one test case

xotcl2.tcl:
    - use object system configuration for -slot.get and -slot.set
    - use value=set instead of value=assign
    - simplify "-parameter" implementation
    - add setters for "name", "domain", and "default" to xotcl::Attribute
      for backward compatibility

mongodb
    - by directing calls to the setter, it is now more complex to
      determine the true calling object for an converter, since the
      set operation might be routed though the slot object.
      It would be nice to have framework support for this.
    - fix 2 error messages
    - provide shorter tracebacks by using "return -code error ..." rather
       than "error ..."

nx::test:
    - don't delete system slot ::xotcl::Attribute on cleanup

nx.tcl:
- add slot method value=unset to nx::RelationSlot and nx::VariableSlot
- extended regression test
- reworked error message generation of slot-forwarder
  (list all available slot methods with prefix value=)
- cleaned up relation slot mixin variants

xotcl2:
- use xotcl::RelationSlot instead of nx::Relationslot in xotcl2
  (we can more value=assign here).

Makefile:
- fix load paths for sublibs (e.g. mongodb) in regression test

nsf.c:
- added nsf::var::get and "::nx::var get" to provide selector
  based interface for variable reading (used in slot-method get
  of nx::VariableSlot)
- renamed nsf::relation to nsf::relation::set and added
  nsf::relation::get in accordance with nsf::var::get
- fixed unary argument passing notation for "-nocomplain"
  of nsf::var and for 42 other options of other commands

nx.tcl:
- added flag -nocomplain to "/obj/ /prop/ unset ?-nocomplain?"
- use "mixin|filter clear" instead of "mixin|filter unset"
- name parameter option "slotset" instead of "slotassign"
- have "filter|mixin clear" return the list of former|removed
  filters|mixins.

nsfObj.c:
- allow to omit "-guard" within arguments to flag
  definition of a filter/mixin guard
- extended regression test

nsf.c:
- improve handling of space in object names
- added methods
     "info lookup filters ?-guards? ?/pattern/?" and
     "info lookup methods ?-guards? ?/pattern/?"

nsf.c
- force again literal "-guard" in a "mixinreg" type to avoid
  potential confusions
- Base nsfRelationSet for mixins on cmds rather than TclObjs
  to avoid confusions and duplication of guard detection logic
- Add interp to NsfMixinregGet() and NsfFilterregGet() to be
  able to return error messages
- return more error message from mixinreg converter
- provide at least minimal support for "funny class names"
  (i.e. containing spaces)
- FinalObjectDeletion: don't enforce namespace = 1 for cases
  with weird namespace deletion order
- extended regression test

nx.tcl
- switch from "/obj/ info parameter" -> "nsf::parameter::get"
  to reduce potential semantic confusion of info options.
  "info parameter" was not object/class specific at all, but
  is just a syntax extractor

nsf.c:
- extend nsf::parameter::get to obtained more detailed information
  for objects/classes/metaclasses/baseclasses and specified types
- extend regression test

- Updated tutorial and migration guide

nx.tcl
- drop short form "/obj/ info configure" for now
- make output of "/obj/ info lookup configure syntax" equivalent to
  "/obj/ info configure"

gentclAPI.tcl:
- handle duplicated domains by folding these to a single definition

nsf.c:
- added command nsf::method::get.
  Rationale: provide a central place to obtain information
  about all kind of method handles, which might be
   - scripted and c-based methods
   - nsf::procs
   - plain tcl procs
   - cmds (with and without parameter definitions)
- make results of ListMethod() robust against missing
  information (e.g. plain tcl cmds, missing object registrations,
  etc.)
- factor out common code for ListMethod call sites
  for per-object methods, instance methods and procs/cmds
  to ListMethodResolve()
- return errors from failing converter registrations
- extend regression test (new test set nsf-method.test)

nsf.c
- renamed parameter::get -> parameter::info
- renamed method::get -> cmd::info

nsf.c, gentclAPI.tcl:
- new argument types "virtualobjectargs" and "virtualclassargs" for
  context-specific argument resolutions: when a context object
  is provided, arguments of type "virtualobjectargs" are determined
  based on the slots applicable for the object (like "... lookup ..."),
  arguments of type "virtualclassargs" are resolved against a class.
  These types are used as follows:
    /obj/ configure /virtualobjectargs/
    /cls/ create /name/ /virtualclassargs/
    /cls/ recreate /name/ /virtualclassargs/
    /cls/ new ?-childof /obj/? /virtualclassargs/
  This new feature allows us to provide better error messages and
  to make much of the "... info ... configure parameter ..."
  infrastructure much less important.
- For "virtualclassargs" we need the functionality to obtain
  from the C-Code based on a class the configure parameters
  applicable to objects of this class.
- add argument "-context ..." to "cmd::info" to pass the context object
  (so far the only place where the context-object is used)
- object system configuration parameters changes:
    new: -class.configureparameter
    new: -object.configureparameter
    removed: -class.objectparameter

nsf.c:
- added options to filter output from ::nsf::cmd::info parameter options
  (args, syntax, parameter)
- deleted:
    - "/obj/ info lookup configure parameters ?pattern?"
    - "/obj/ info lookup configure syntax"
- added:
    - "/obj/ info lookup parameters /methodName/ ?pattern?"
    - "/obj/ info lookup syntax /methodName/ ?pattern?"
  This covers as well
    - "/obj/ info lookup parameters configure|create|new|... ?pattern?"
- extend regression test

mongo:
- upgrade to the newly released version 0.96 of the c-driver
- replace deprecated function mongoc_collection_delete by mongoc_collection_remove
- tested with MongoDB v2.6.1

nx.tcl:
- removed
    /cls/ info configure parameters
    /cls/ info configure
    /cls/ info syntax
  Use e.g. "/cls/ info lookup parameters create" instead

moved block here for keeping arguments
=====
- configure parameters: we have to cleanup
  Given:

    nx::Class create Person {
	:property name
	:create p1
    }

    Person info configure            says, how object "Person" can be configured
    Person info configure syntax     says, how instances of "Person" can be configured

    p1 info configure                says, how object p1 can be configured
    p1 info lookup configure syntax  says, how object p1 can be configured (long form of above)

    p1 configure -help               gives a reasonable error message, "p1 configure" does not work, since no args are needed
    Person new -help                 gives a reasonable error message, except, that "configure" is not perfect
    Person create                    just complains about missing name, does not know about configure arguments
    Person create -help              creates an object named "-help"
    Person create foo -help          gives a reasonable error message, except, that "configure" is not perfect

  possible path:
  1) "Person info configure" is dangerous, too close to "Person info configure syntax" but completely different.
      maybe: use "Person info configure" as short form of "Person info configure syntax", or drop it,
      since the lookup variant is at least not surprising.
  2) It would be nice if we would be not to need the "info" at all but improve the errors in 5-9,
     maybe special switch "-?" or "--"

  3) another possible path:

       p1 info lookup syntax configure   (short form of nsf::method::get syntax [p1 info lookup method configure])

     where "configure" is a method name, would work the same way as "p1 info lookup syntax create|foo|..."
     (under the assumption, we get the "right" syntax for configure).
     Similar:

       p1 info lookup parameter configure   (short form of nsf::method::get parameter [p1 info lookup method configure])

     this way, we would not need "info configure" and friends at all.

  Tk uses "/obj/ configure" for obtaining possible values

  Furthermore:
     The command
       p1 info method definition [p1 info lookup method configure]
     gives an error, since "info method" is not defined for p1, we could have used
       p1 info object method definition [p1 info lookup method configure]
     which is somewhat strange, since configure is not an object method.
     Probably: nsf-level command for handles.

====

nsf.c:
- Let "/cls/ info mixinof -closure" return as well implicit mixin classes
  to make it easier to determine class dependencies.

  Example:

     nx::Class create M0
     nx::Class create M1 -superclass M0
     nx::Class create M2 -superclass M1

     nx::Class create C
     nx::Class create D -superclass C

     C mixin add M2

     # M2 is mixed into C, and implicitly into D
     #
     # Since M2 is a subclass of M1, classes C and D depend as well
     # on M1 and M0, as seen in the heritage:

     ? {C info heritage} ":M2 ::M1 ::M0 ::nx::Object"
     ? {D info heritage} ":M2 ::M1 ::M0 ::C ::nx::Object"

     # previously, only "M2 info mixinof -closure" showed the
     # mixin relations, even with "-closure", while M1 and M0 did not.

     ? {M2 info mixinof -closure} "::C ::D"

     # now these show the same relations (in this example).

     ? {M1 info mixinof -closure} "::C ::D"
     ? {M0 info mixinof -closure} "::C ::D"

- adapt mixinof.test to the additional information
- transform mixinof.test to newer style regression test with automated object deletion

- updated migration guide and tutorial to reflect recent changes

nsf.c:
- cleanup of NsfParameterInvalidateClassCacheCmd(): performance improvements.
  After the fixing of indirect mixin validation, performance of invalidation
  went up by a factor of 5. At least, in some important cases (invalidation of
  root-classes like nx::Object / xotcl::Object), we are again on the same level
  as before (actually slightly faster).

- use functions IsRootClass(), IsRootMetaClass() and IsBaseClass()
  to access object/class properties
- add gcc attribute "pure"

- rename
    nsf::parameter:invalidate::classcache -> nsf::parameter::cache::classinvalidate
    nsf::parameter:invalidate::objectcache -> nsf::parameter::cache::objectinvalidate
  reasons: (a) remove single colon inside the name, (b) put verb to the end

- fixed error message for forward ... onerror and method paths. The command
  "C object mixin" returns now
  "::C object mixin add|clear|delete|get|guard|set" and not
  "::C mixin add|clear|delete|get|guard|set" as before.

nsf.c:
- new function DependentSubClasses() to determine all classes that inherit
  from a given class. The result extend TransitiveSubClasses() by including
  class mixin relationships.
- simplify NsfParameterCacheClassInvalidateCmd() by using the new function
  DependentSubClasses(). With the new implementation,
  NsfParameterCacheClassInvalidateCmd() is as efficient as before without
  to MostGeneralSuperclass optimization (but being complete now) when
  working on the root classes (an more efficient on subclasses).
- added experimental code feature CYCLIC_MIXIN_ERROR

nsf.c:
- improve performance of MixinInvalidateObjOrders() by about 30%
  by recompiling the list of the dependent classes over and over again,
  since MixinInvalidateObjOrders() iterates over the full list already.
- Document NsfRelationClassMixinsSet() and add nonnull declarations and
  the usual assertions()

nsf.c
- base MixinInvalidateObjOrders() on DependentSubClasses() and
  avoid the need of using a separate hash table for class-mixin
  handling. The new implementation is several times faster and
  improves the speed of the functions CleanupDestroyClass(),
  SuperclassAdd() and NsfRelationClassMixinsSet(). Adding a
  class-mixin to ::xotcl::Object in OpenACS is more than 4x faster.
- remove obsolete function MixinResetOrderForInstances()
- rename ResetOrderOfClassesUsedAsMixins() to
  ResetOrderOfObjectsUsingThisClassAsObjectMixin()
- used consistently DependentSubClasses() instead of TransitiveSubClasses()
  for invalidations.
- extended regression test

nsf.c:
- added option "-dependent" to "info subclass"
- extended regression test

nsf.c:
- move NsfMethodNamePath() out of NsfObjWrongArgs()
- move NsfMethodNamePath() out of NsfUnexpectedArgumentError() and NsfUnexpectedNonposArgumentError()
- fix name paths in error messages triggered from ArgumentParse()
- use 3-argument version of NsfMethodNamePath()
- don't invalidate class-level param caches during shutdown

nsf.c: parameter passing reform
- don't pass full argument list for filtering methods calle further
  methods from C (such as new/create/... ) to allow processing of e.g. "--" in "new"
  to separate arguments to "new" cleanly from arguments passed to "create".
  Now we can use e.g. "C new -- -childof 123" in case class C has a property "childof".
- extend c-generator to accept option "-objv0" to pass the original "objv[0]" to the
  called command. Since we had previously "allargs", we have to pass the objv[0] now
  differently
- more thorough checking ISOBJ(someObj) macro for asserts
  (use "assert(ISOBJ(someObj))" instead of just "assert(someObj)")
- extend regression test

nsf.c:
- checked, that all CallDirectly() cases, where method is dispatched
  (no direct call) are covered by the regression tests
- avoid double memcpy() in dispatch recreate by using ObjectDispatch()
  rather than CallMethod()
- removed memcpy() in call-directly for "create"
- some more cleanup

gentclAPI.tcl:
- added option "-flags", which can be used for every parameter.
  example: .... -flags NSF_ARG_NOLEADINGDASH ....
- experimental: use NSF_ARG_NOLEADINGDASH for pattern "info subclass"
  to improve error messages.
- extended regression test

nsf.c:
- relax the meaning of noleadingdash to allow negative numbers
- rename noleadingdash to e.g. nodashalnum

nsf.c:
- define means to protect "undefined" internally-directly called methods
  __alloc and __dealloc in nx. This is achieved mostly via a an
  additional value in a method declaration in ::nsf::objectsystem::create.
  Example:
    -class.dealloc {__dealloc ::nsf::methods::class::dealloc 1}
- extend regression test


nsf.c:
- allow abbreviated nonpos args
- change name of relation slot "superclass" to "superclasses".
  (part of a planned change to use plural for set-valued parameters,
  "info superclasses" and similar changes for mixins/filters will
  probably follow)

nx.tcl: pluralism reform part 2
- changed methods
    /cls/ info subclass -> /cls/ info subclasses
    /cls/ info superclass -> /cls/ info superclasses
    /cls/ mixin ... -> /cls/ mixins
    /cls/ filter ... -> /cls/ filters
    /cls/ object mixin ... -> /cls/ object mixins
    /cls/ object filter ... -> /cls/ object filters
- changed configure parameters
    /cls/ configure -mixin -> /cls/ configure -mixins
    /cls/ configure -filter -> /cls/ configure -filters
    /obj/ configure -object-mixin -> /obj/ configure -object-mixins
    /obj/ configure -object-filter -> /obj/ configure -object-filters
- added handling for calling relation slot with unknown sub method


nx.tcl:
- make all __* system methods in nx redefine-protected
- let "nsf::configure objectsystem" return handles and protections as well

nx.tcl: pluralism reform part 3
- introduced simple plural form "mixins" and "filters" for introspection
- moved differentiated interface into slot methods.
  the slot methods "get" stay symmetrically to "set",
  but additional methods "classes" or "methods" are used
  like "guard" to obtain partial results of the
  mixin and filter specs
- changed info methods
    /cls/ info mixin classes         -> /cls/ info mixins
    /cls/ info filter methods        -> /cls/ info filters
    /obj/ info object mixin classes  -> /obj/ info object mixins
    /obj/ info object filter methods -> /obj/ info object filters
- dropped
    /cls/ info mixin guard
    /cls/ info filter guard
    /obj/ info object mixin guard
    /obj/ info object filter guard
- added
    /cls/ mixins classes
    /cls/ filters methods
    /obj/ object filters methods
    /obj/ object mixins classes
- asymmetry between "/obj/ info lookup mixins" vs. "/obj/ info ?object? mixin classes" resolved.

nsf.c:
- dropped unused object::info::is
- renamed
   ::nsf::methods::class::info::filtermethods  -> ::nsf::methods::class::info::filters
   ::nsf::methods::object::info::filtermethods -> ::nsf::methods::object::info::filters
   ::nsf::methods::class::info::mixinclasses   -> ::nsf::methods::class::info::mixins
   ::nsf::methods::object::info::mixinclasses  -> ::nsf::methods::object::info::mixins

nsf.c:
- provide error messages for ambiguous abbreviations
- extend regression test (now 5460 tests)

nsf.c:
- see no need, why we should "set nodashalnum for int types"
- extended regression test

nsf.c:
- remove redundant null check for object and add assertion

documentation:
- add current args to migration guide
- fix cut&paste error: replace "current currentclass" by "current calledclass"

Migration guide and tutorial:
- updated "/cls/ info superclasses" and "/cls/ info subclasses"
- updated "/cls/ info mixins" and "/obj/ info object mixins"
- updated "/cls/ info filters" and "/obj/ info object filters"
- dropped "/cls/ info mixin guard" and "/obj/ info object mixin guard"
  dropped "/cls/ info filter guard" and "/obj/ info object filter guard"
  (use "-guard option instead)
- updated "/cls/ mixins ...", "/obj/ object mixins ...",
  "/cls/ filteres ...", "/obj/ object filters ..."

nsf.h
- In Tcl 8.6.1 it might be that a Tcl_Obj has length > 0 but bytes == NULL. We have
  to relax out tcl_obj-sanity test for this case from assertions.

nsf.c:
- remove redundant definition
- reduce variable scope
- make sure to follow nonnull assumptions

nsf.c:
- implement a new approach to error reporting in ensembles:
  instead of trying to find the "right" place to report the best "error",
  compute the longest valid ensemble prefix from all the stack frames.

nx.tcl:
- simplify the info ensembles on nx::Object or nx::Class significantly,
  by making use if ensemble-next.
- delete "info unknown", since this is not called.

nsf.c:
- make types for bit operations unsigned (mostly flags)

build system:
- don't call genstubs from configure, since Debian does not seem
  to have genstubs.tcl installed. Now, we pre-generate the
  stub files for tcl8.5 and tcl8.6 and copy the "right" version
  depending on the configured version.

- Make dtplite configurable in Makefile, e.g.
     make "DTPLITE=/usr/local/ns/bin/tclsh8.5 /usr/local/ns/bin/dtplite" man

- regenerate documentation
- bump version number to 2.0.0 (also in .man files)

- write body-blocks of if on separate lines
- change variable name "validCscPtr" to "isValidCsc", since
  it is a boolean and not a ptr (tcl coding guidelines)
- prefer explicit comparisons
- remove test, since it is covered already by assertions


- Is NsfParamDefs.slotObj obsolete?

  Right now, the slot objs responsible for (method) parameters are
  stored along with each Nsf_Param, and not as a
  NsfParamDefs.slotObj. NsfParamDefs.slotObj is not used actively,
  ::nsf::method::property slotobj is dysfunctional (expects extra
  argument, which cannot be provided + control-flow issue CID 88767).

  pt. 1: For the time being, I removed ::nsf::method::property slotobj
  entirely (also to fix CID 88767). Seems harmless, not tested
  explicitly, not required by object-system scripts, ...

  pt. 2: NsfParamDefs.slotObj and its memory-management statements all
  over remain in place, to be reviewed.

- removed  NsfParamDefs.slotObj (and single occurrence for memory-management)
  since it is not used for the time being
- fix potential bug on tcl-triggered cmd-delete operations, where
  destroy returns non-TCL_OK and name of the object could not be
  retrieved anymore in error message.
- move dereferencing of members after assertions

- improve robustness of destroy: in case an error happened in a
  destroy method in implicit delete operations, a crash was possible,
  since the state of the object to be delete was somewhat unclear
  (it might or might not have been deleted). Now, the object
  is explicitly kept longer around to allow proper handling).

- update licenses

- reduce implicit conversions
- write body of if-statements as blocks
- whitespace changes
- prefer boolean expressions
- add likely/unlikely hints

- added optional parameter "-target" for serializer to ease
  changing name of object in serialization

- new command nsf::method::forward::property in analogy to nsf::method::property
  for reading+writing introspection of forwarders (important for serializer,
  when different target objects are specified, to map the per-object forwarder)
- extended regression test
- bumped version number of serializer to 2.1


- Fixed a bug that disallowed the combination of valuecmd and
  valuechangedcmd for a single property (many thanks to Zoran
  for pointing this out)

Removed implicit substdefault for configure parameters in nx:
- The syntax of substdefault for method parameters and configure
  parameters was different. For method parameters, it was necessary to
  specify :substdefault per parameter to activate it, for configure
  parameter is was based in the XOTcl tradition on the content of the
  default (whether it contains [...])  One problem is, that there was
  no easy way to turn this feature off. If one wants to provide a
  script block as a default, it was necessary to escape all square
  brackets.
- Now, in nx, one has to specify :substdefault for configure
  parameter explicitly as well, syntax for configure and method
  parameters is the same.
- XOTcl 2.0 keeps implicit substdefaults (backward compatible)
- fix bug: never try to substdefault, when there is no default given.
- don't swallow errors triggered from variable write traces in configure
- handle result of Tcl_ObjSetVar2() in all cases


- Use standard logging for
      nsf::__profile_trace ... -verbose true ...
  By using the standard logging mechanism, we can redefining
  ::nsf::log to output e.g. trace in a GUI.
- Add argument "-dontsave" to nsf::__profile_trace
  to avoid saving trace in memory
- Refactor trace and debug output to deliver lists.
  This makes it easier to postprocess the results from Tcl.

Profile trace enhancements:
- add optional argument "-builtins" to nsf::__profile_trace
  to trace a selected list of builtins. Every element of the
  list passed to "-builtins" might contain a cmd name and
  optionally a maximum number of arguments to be shown
  (typically 0 or 1)
- generalized NsfReplaceCommand* logic to become more general
  usable (e.g. for the builtins mechanism of nsf::__profile_trace)

- New macros NSF_nonnull_assert() and nonnull_assert()
  Background: The unreleased gcc6 with "-pedantic"
  complaints since recently about asserts, in which nonnull
  conditions implied by nonnull declarations are explicitly
  tested, and spits out warnings like
      ... warning: nonnull argument ... compared to NULL ...
  The new macros turns off asserts, when gcc6 is used.

- new introspection methods:
     "/obj/ info object method callprotection /m/"
     "/cls/ info method callprotection /m/"
     "/obj/ info baseclass"
- extended regression test


- added nsf::method::property /obj/ /method/ debug ?0|1?
  when debug is activated, a debug line written to the log file when
  the function is called and exited

- added nsf::method::property /obj/ /method/ deprecated ?0|1?
  when deprecated is activated, a warning written to the log file when
  the function is called

- added flags to nsf::proc: -debug and -deprecated
  (can als be set via nsf::method::property with an arbitrary object
   and proc passed fully qualified)

- bumped version number to 2.0.1

- handling flags "-deprecated" and "-debug" properties for nsf::proc
  (in "nsf::cmd::info definition /proc/" and serializer)
- extended regression test for introspecting nsf::cmd::info definition
  and flags "-deprecated" and "-debug"

- nx: added new introspection options
    /cls/ info method debug
    /cls/ info method deprecated
    /obj/ info object method debug
    /obj/ info object method deprecated

- nx: added flag "-debug" and "-deprecated" to methods
    "method"
    "object method"
    "alias"
    "object alias"
    "forward"
    "object forward"
   such one can use e.g.
   /cls/ public alias   -deprecated|-debug /method/ ...
   /cls/ public forward -deprecated|-debug /method/ ...
   /cls/ public method  -deprecated|-debug /method/ ...
   /obj/ public object alias   -deprecated|-debug /method/ ...
   /obj/ public object forward -deprecated|-debug /method/ ...
   /obj/ public object method  -deprecated|-debug /method/ ...

- added new cmd:
    nsf::method::property /obj/ ?-per-object? /method/ exists
  to check, whether a method is defined for an object.

- output triggered via "-debug" is now generated via the
  tcl functions "nsf::debug::call" and "nsf::debug::exit",
  that can be redefined (similar to e.g. nsf::deprecated)

- cleanup of nsfProfile.c commands

- defined macros ObjectName_() and ClassName_() that behave
  like the versions without "_", but do not check the passed
  arg against NULL. This avoids warnings in newest versions
  of gcc6 and cppcheck.

- extended regression test

serializer:
- added handling of "-debug" and "-deprecated" in serializer
- allow export of nsfprocs via "exportMethods declaration"
  in order to keep otherwise excluded cmds in the result.
  this allows us to keep nsf::debug::* or nsf::deprecated
  definitions in the blueprint in OpenACS.
- hardened serializer (use e.g. "::namespace" instead
  of "namespace" when there is a potential conflict with
  a method named "namespace", prefer nsf::directdispatch, etc.)
- extended regression test

- fix potential memory corruption bug in NsfDStringVPrintf()

- replace all remaning ObjectName and ClassName with variant with
  trailing "_" when appropriate
- allow nsf::procs with zero arguments or plain arguments (when
  "-debug" is used
- extended regression test
- bump version number to 2.1


- make use of Tcl_SaveInterpState() and friends for saving results
  in NsfDStringEval()
- added results in debug exit calls
- changed interface of NsfDStringEval to control behavior via bitflags
  (this is after all more readable than a argument list of "0" and "1"s)
- added optional recursion prevention for functions called via NsfDStringEval
  (handling NSF_EVAL_DEBUG, NSF_EVAL_LOG, NSF_EVAL_DEPRECATED)
- added regression tests for potential recursive calls

- added flags "-debug" and "-deprecated" to XOTcl 2 "instproc", "proc", 
  "instforward" and "forward" methods

- turned all for-loops controlled over a nonnull value into while loops
- updated TODO, copyright notices, version number

- Let nsf create classes with ::nsf::object::unknown handler in the fly, when
  c-function are called with objects of type class. This is necessary for 
  triggering creation attempts in ttrace via 
      ::nsf::object::alloc SOMECLASS SOMEOBJ

- added Tcl_HashKeyType cmdPtrHashKeyType for command pointers

- gcc6:
  * gcc6 seems to have a bug: when e.g. a variable "foo" is declared as nonnull,
    then the construct

      do {
        ...
        foo = foo->nextPtr;
      } while (foo != NULL);

    will raise a warning, despite of the fact that foo is overwritten.
    
    This was reported and confirmed as a false positive; to be fixed
    in future gcc6.

- Re-factored new hash-table infrastructure (based on function-pointer
  keys) to support method-definitions (and future uses as well).

- Allow combination of "-trace get" with default value (was previously disallowed)
- Extend regression test

xotcl2:
- added "-returns" flag to XOTcl's instprocs/procs and methods, 
  very similar to "-returns" in nx
- extended serializer to handle "-returns" flag
- extended regression test

========================================================================
TODO:

- Shouldn't we add debug/deprecated filters for "info methods", i.e.:
  ... info methods ?-debug? ?-deprecated? ?-callprotection all|public|protected|private? ?-closure? ?-type all|scripted|builtin|alias|forwarder|object|setter|nsfproc? ?-path? ?-source all|application|system? ?/pattern/?"


- add to doc:
   "-returns" flag for instproc/proc in XOTcl2

   # in case, when similar cmds are commented, add:
   #
   nsf::proc -debug /name/ ...
   nsf::proc -deprecated /name/ ...
   nsf::method::property /obj/ ?-per-object? /method/ exists
   nsf::method::property /obj/ ?-per-object? /method/ debug ?0|1?
   nsf::method::property /obj/ ?-per-object? /method/ deprecated ?0|1?

- maybe better handling of single-colon prefixed vars in trace procs,
  when passing values to nsf::var::set/get/...

- maybe more complete handling of other forward "properties"

- should we change "/obj/ info lookup syntax /methodName/" to return obj and method as well?
  (similar to "info method syntax /methodName/")

- we could drop methods::object::info::objectparameter

- check deactivated tests in tests/serialize.test
  C(One), C(IgnoreAll), C(None2)
  and xlloc fix

Stefan: doc items

 - make rough comparison table with NX, XOTcl, tclOO, itcl, Ruby, Python
   comparison NX vs. TclOO is most probably the most important
   Most general superclass
   Metaclass
   Per-object methods
   Per-Object mixins -- none, class, or class hierarchy
   Per-Class mixins -- none, class, or class hierarchy
   transitive mixins classes
   Per-object filters
   Per-class filters
   aliases
   Traits
   Composite Traits
   Method protection public/protected/private
   positional arguments   none, leading args, arbitrary
   argument value checkers
   Create objects classes with no callable methods

 - doc/tutorial2.html

 - warnings for "numeric" names for args and nonpos-args?
 - special handling of values looking like nonpos-flags,
   but wich are not ones (-1, "- a b c", ....) in detection
   when to throw unknown.

 - interface of "variable" and "attribute":
   * add switch -array for "variable"? (Just setting is trivial,
     handling setters and incremental setter is more work)

- extend mongo::gridfs::store_file with a switch -metadata to
  pass metadata together at gridfs file creation time

- do we have to adjust the documentation in xotcl2 for object initialization?
- maybe optional arg (true) to ::nsf::object::initialized
  to generalize -noinit

- maybe: add a disposition=pipe

- maybe: add "-asHTML" as style option to parametersyntax

- MixinComputeOrderFullList() could receive a flag to store
  source classes in checkList

- if the check on eg. info-heritage-circular in test/info.method.tcl
  reports a warning on exit, if we get an exception.

- what to do with metadata analyzer?
  Still needed? Already replaced by new doctool?
  Does it have to run on make? Can doctool run on Make?

- Higher binary compatibility for future versions:
  * It is not nice to have the full Nsf_Param structure in nsf.h
    (required for Nsf_methodDefinition in the c code generator)
  * It is not nice to have the full ParseContext structure in nsfmongo
    (required for the allocation of the parse context in the stubs)
  Adding fields to these structures would kill alder binaries

- when alloc|dealloc are loaded via require, we have
  no redefined-protection on those. Since the script does not know,
  on which class|object these are defined one cannot make assumption
  on these. Problem?

- The structure of the script body requires currently that
  "class|object ?-per-object?" is inserted at the 1st pos.
  This is not sufficient, if we would like to test in this
  script, whether the first arg is e.g. a class.

- document value added replacements of Tcl functions

- configure parameter type forward:
   - regression test
   - get rid of eager tcd creation (optimization, can go to future releases)

- slotmachinerie 2
  - should we deactivate add/delete for non-multivalued cases?
  - allow noarg+default/initcmd ?
  - default/initcmd/subsdefault: can we simplify these?
    or add messages for conflicting usages.

- Makefile/::nsf::config: Integrate git meta-data (commit hash, branch/tag labels)

- doc:

    * no-accessor properties/slots are still reported as methods: class

    * method parameters need indentation ...

    * method ensembles are reported as "Implementation details: alias", is this ok?

   * doc validator reports weird info submethods: info definition,
     info names, info objects -> mean "info slot *" ... smells like
     generator garbage ...

   * inconsistency: "info slot *" are built on "slotsobjects" which
     does not take -source and -closure parameters ... still, they
     are in the NX method interfaces ... review and document accordingly.

   * sub-method cross-references per @use does not work (parameters
     are not reproduced, probably no [:origin] resolution is
     performed: See the case for "info properties" -> "info slot
     definition"

   * "info method": elaborate on the options, right now the doc is
     minimal ...

   * "info method" -> why does the parameter syntax does not report all
     enumeration literals, rather than ?infomethodsubcmd? ???

    * fix sub methods validation reporting -> mismatch?

    * Ensemble methods: obj info & friends ... there is no
      parametersyntax reported; add something literal in the template:
      <sub-method> ?

    * Object|Class mixin|filter guard -> how to document (and not
      reported by nxdoc as missing either, as their as slot-specific)?
      And link to Class class filterguard|mixinguard ... Why not
      defining the latter as ensembles "Class class filter|mixin
      guard"?

    * Ensemble methods, i.e. intermediate ones, should not be filter
      by inheritance in the nxdoc output. For example, info() in Class
      shares many details of info in Object, but it does not visualize
      this quasi-inheritance

    * @package.@require(): really needed?

    * @package.@version: fix validation mode ... expected/actual
      version numbers are not compared ...

    * NextScriptingLanguage/index.html: glossary entries in nsf.nxd
      should be sorted (in the source) ...... Maybe, a single glossary.nxd
      file?  SS: Right now, the name of the nxd file derives from the the
      script name. I mark this as TODO for the future.

    * doc/langRef2.xotcl vs library/xotcl/doc/langRef.xotcl

    * @author: how to visualise the authorship in the generated markup
      (yuidoc)?


- do we need contains in nx?

- nsf::proc
   * check, if there are parameter types that should not be applicable
     for nsf::proc
   * toplevel (object less) introspection

- documentation
   * migration guide
      3.8. Dispatch, Aliases, etc.: to be done or omitted

- check performance implications of value checker

- library + XOTcl apps
    - work on binary packages of xotcl (store + xml)
    - nicht gewartete/nicht getestete library aus distro entfernen?
    - migration von einzelnen paketen nach next? von welchen?


Ein paar Punkte im folgenden könnten obsolet sein:

TODO "Kleinigkeiten"

- should we continue to work on the problem of the interp-aliased class,
  exported from one ns, imported into another one?

- constants in type converter (in and out)


#if 1
  /* the following check operations is xotcl1 legacy and is not
     generic. it should be replaced by another methodproperty.
     Most of the is*String()
     definition are then obsolete and should be deleted from
     xotclInt.h as well.
  */

  if (isCheckString(methodName)) {
    return TCL_OK;
  }
#endif


For future releases (after first alpha/beta release)

 - cmd introspection:
   nsf defines a commands (e.g. nsf::proc) and unregistered methods.
   The interfaces of these commands can be queried via methods

      % nx::Object info method parameters ::nsf::proc
      -ad:switch procName arguments body
      % nx::Object info method syntax ::nsf::proc
      /cls/ proc ?-ad? /procName/ /arguments/ /body/
      % nx::Object info method definition ::nsf::proc
      Warning: Could not obtain alias definition for proc...

    which return only partially correct results (the first is correct,
    the second one is misleading, the error message can be improved
    for the third case.

    maybe
       ::nsf::info command parameters|syntax /cmd/
    might make sense, but there might be more candidates
    for nsf::info around. OTOH, we have already
    nsf::object::exists, nsf::is, etc.

  * generalizing parameter-specific per-object info
    Now we have
      __initcmd(varname) for init-cmds of variable traces
      __cmd(varname) for the eval-ed cmds (mostly
                     for documentation purposes
                     to postprocess the init block
    We could need
       __required_satisfied(varname) to handle
                     required parameter aliases
    As generalization, we could use a dict
       __parameterstate(varname)
    or even
       __parameterstate
    with a dict to collect the various aspects.
    for performance reasons, we do not want to set this
    variable too frequent, serialization and blueprint
    aspects have to be considered. This would as well
    address cases, where the parameter has a different name
    than the associated variable (e.g. private properties)

 * Currently, in NX, specifying mandatory parameters may break
   object construction as init won't receive any arguments (no
   residual args). We should provide a warning when a user
   defines arguments for init (or provide some other syntactic sugar)

 * extend traits (object-specific traits, test cases, etc.)

 * RFE: forwarders/aliases: -checkalways is missing.
   Issues:
   1) limit to -returns only?

    checkalways affects only input-parameters, not return.
    (purpose: make it possible to rely on parameter checking
    from external sources, no matter whether checking is turned
    on/off). furthermore, it effects only checking for procs.
    For C-implemented commands, there is no way to avoid e.g.
    checking if something is an integer, since the binary
    representation of the integer is passed.

    so i don't understand "limit to -returns".

   2) cover value checkers of method parameters also,
      effectively overruling -checkalways settings of the
      aliased/forwarded nsf::proc or method?

      i guess that this is based on the assumption,
      there would be value-checkers for forwarders
      or aliases. Then one would have to handle the
      conflicts. However, forwarders and aliases
      pass arguments around without having any knowledge
      about parameter definitions. They don't check
      anything by design.

  * RFE Revisit nsf::*::assertion interface? Why does nsf::method::assertion
    allow for setting invariants. One would rather expect a
    ::nsf::object|class::assertion or the like?

       The reason for the current naming is simply that assertions
       are only implemented for scripted methods.
         * pre/post conditions are just checked for scripted methods,
           since only these have stack frames, which are necessary
           to access self or the resolver variables.
         * invariants are only checkable during scripted methods,
           there is no way to intercept c-based functions.
           Checking these before/after c-implemented functions
           should be possible though.

  * REF: feature request 'remove "-guard" from mixin and filter specs, just have two-element lists'
    would require to have different sets of converters for slots depending on object system

  * add maybe "::nsf::object::property /obj/ volatile 0|1" to alter
    volatile state.

  * Reduce / remove hard-code names. Right now, "method"/"alias"/
    "forward" is returned by "info definition" introspection.
    This is not serious, since e.g. XOTcl handles this on the
    script level by mapping these names to the XOTcl counterparts.
    We could as well make this configurable via the object-system
    parameters.

   * Consider alternate method name/place for subcmds (and/or slots) on classes
     - currently, there are potential conflicts between slots and ensemble objects
     - provide a different place in the namespaces could simplify this

   * Cleanup the set of active filters when filters are removed (only relevant
     for the speed of scripts with filters and a high number of instances)

   * Ensembles
     - It could be possible to reduce stack frames in ensembles. Just a
       top ensemble frame could be sufficient.
     - The full names for ensemble methods could be stored in the cmd tables
       to make lookup faster.

  * Serializer: handing of xo::at_cleanup in serializer
     (either generalization or move to OpenACS/aolserver init/naviserver init)

  * Parameter/argument handling
     - Add an unknown handler for unknown non-pos args to Argument parser.
       The problem is to find a way to avoid method deletions or redefinitions
       or to recover from these gracefully (when e.g. the unknown handler
       deletes the parameters currently being worked on).
    - Canonical parameter representations:
      "p:integer,multivalued" => "-name p -type integer -multivalued"
      "x:type,arg=::D d1" => "-name x -type type -arg ::D -default d1"
    - Argument passing of C functions is currently based on an
      interpreter of the argument lists. It should be possible to turn
      the interpreter into a compiler to speed up argument passing. But
      maybe, this would bloat the code-size.
    - Use parameter syntax in genTclAPI
    - better handling of "c1 cget -noinit" ?

  * experimental features:
     - document/extend/generalize/remove the experimental object properties
       perobjectdispatch and keepcallerself
     - behavior on keepcallerself on ordinary dispatches with implicit/explicit
       receiver (currently the flag is ignored, the code just commented out)

  * C-Code
     * Several of the tracing options in nsf.h could be replaced by DTrace
     * Rework implicit namespace completion (NameInNamespaceObj(),
       maybe based on BeginOfCallChain()).
     * Rework C-interface (maybe for post-alpha, but we have be first
       clear on scope and intention. A possibility would be to provide
       all entries from gentclAPI, but we would loose most likely
       static property and the newly achieved ease of changing is
       effectively frozen by the stubs interface, which has to be
       stable.
     * NsfClassListAdd() and friends could be made generic

  * Coroutines
     - extend coro regression test
     - coro-enable nsf::proc

  * reenable/translate deleted XOTcl demo scripts, such as
    e.g. those from library/xotcl/apps/scripts




observation:
- [current isnextcall] does not work for ensemble next:
  ... but should probably not, since this is an implicit
  next call just for resolving an ensemble call.

Object create o {
  :public object method foo {} {return [current isnextcall]}
  :public object method "x y" {} {return [current isnextcall]}
}
Class create M {
  :public method foo {} {next}
  :public method "x y" {} {next}
}

? {o foo} 0
? {o x y} 0
o object mixins add M
? {o foo} 1
? {o x y} 1; # gives 0 ...
