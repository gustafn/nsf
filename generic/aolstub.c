 *
 * NsNsf_Init1 --
 *
 *      Loads the package in each thread-interpreter.
 *      This is needed since Nsf Class/Object commands are not copied
 *      from the startup thread to the connection (or any other) thread.
 *      during AOLserver initialization and/or thread creation times.
 *
 *      Why ?
 *
 *      Simply because these two commands declare a delete callback which is
 *      unsafe to call in any other thread but in the one which created them.
 *
 *      To understand this, you may need to get yourself acquainted with the
 *      mechanics of the AOLserver, more precisely, with the way Tcl interps
 *      are initialized (dive into nsd/tclinit.c in AOLserver distro).
 *
 *      So, we made sure (by patching the AOLserver code) that no commands with
 *      delete callbacks declared, are ever copied from the startup thread.
 *      Additionally, we also made sure that AOLserver properly invokes any
 *      AtCreate callbacks. So, instead of activating those callbacks *after*
 *      running the Tcl-initialization script (which is the standard behavior)
 *      we activate them *before*. So we may get a chance to configure the
 *      interpreter correctly for any commands within the init script.
 *
 *      Proper Nsf usage would be to declare all resources (classes, objects)
 *      at server initialization time and let AOLserver machinery to copy them
 *    (or re-create them, better yet) in each new thread.
 *      Resources created within a thread are automatically garbage-collected
 *      on thread-exit time, so don't create any Nsf resources there.
 *      Create them in the startup thread and they will automatically be copied
 *      for you.
 *      Look in <serverroot>/modules/tcl/nsf for a simple example.
 *
 * Results:
 *      Standard Tcl result.
 *
 * Side effects:
 *      Tcl commands created.
