	* serializer.tcl: Reduce verbosity [2b4b817c]

2024-10-08  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu.ac.at>

	* doc/Announce2.5.0: Adding to announcement: 2.5.0 and 25th
	anniversary [b27afbdc]

2024-10-06  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* ChangeLog-2.0.0-2.1.0.log, ChangeLog-2.4.0-HEAD: Improved
	spelling [87ba4a57]

	* xotcl2.tcl, Httpd.xotcl, Mime.xotclTcl 9 fix: fixed handling of
	leading "~" in file paths.  In the Unix shell tradition, leading
	"~" in file paths denotes to the home directory. In Tcl9, we have
	to use [file home] instead.
	[d861f735]

2024-10-06  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* nx.tcl: Added method nx::Object->"info consts" A "const" is a
	variable that cannot be altered later.  So far, such constant
	variables have to be created via the Tcl 9 "const" cmd, like in the
	example below.  The introspection method "/obj/ info consts" is
	very similar to "/obj/ info vars", but it lists only unmodifiable
	variables. [0ca02a31]

2024-10-06  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* tutorial2.html: Fixed typo (space was missing)
	[f56a27fa]

	* nsf.c (ParamFreeInternalRep): Re-establish sanity check
	[be661e5a]

	* nsf.c, nsfObj.c: minor cleanup of debug and log messages
	[27f3f462]

2024-10-04  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* nsf.c (ExitHandler): Improved warning message, when Tcl command
	"::history" is not defined [6862550e]

	* nsf.c: Updated year in comment [15dbd946]

2024-10-04  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* nsfInt.h: Fix for otherwise false positive in memcount
	statistics. Before, we saw messages like the following
	accompanied with wrong memcount statistics, when running
	library/xotcl/tests/testo.xotcl [7ce64a20]

	******** MEM COUNT ALERT: Trying to free 0x14f91fc10 <Tcl_Obj* *>,
	but was not allocated

2024-10-04  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* parameters.test: improved decoupling of test cases [59dadd01]

2024-10-04  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu.ac.at>

	* doc/Announce2.4.1, ChangeLog-2.4.0-HEAD: Add Announce2.4.1 and
	ChangeLog-2.4.0-HEAD drafts [deebac4d]

2024-10-03  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu.ac.at>

	* nsf.c (NsfParamWrapper, ParamDupInteralRep): Tcl 9 reform:
	Refcounting nsfParam intrep was simplified and fixed by removing
	the canFree flag, now relying purely on the refcounts. This fixes
	a memory leak when a Tcl_Obj holding an nsfParam intrep gets
	duplicated. [0361c4b0]

2024-10-03  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* nsfObj.c (MethodFreeInternalRep): Added casts to debug output
	[5ee4c3c7]

	* nsf.c, nsf.h (CompiledColonLocalsLookupBuildCache): Make
	handling of colonLocalVarCache more type-safe Since the usual
	macro TCL_SIZE_T does not work together with the macros for the
	memcount macros, a new typedef "Nsf_Tcl_Size_t" was
	introduced. Using a typedef is better and eases maintenance. The
	new typedef has a "Nsf_" prefix, since it is defined in nsf.h.
	[64ee56cd]

	* nx.tcl: Address leak of NsfMethodContext with Tcl 9. This is not
	a fully satisfying fix, since it just fixes the symptom, not the
	cause.  Also the old variant is supposed to run free of this
	issue. However, we are talking here about a single Tcl_Obj inside
	the NX object system, so the harm is very limited. More details in
	the ticket. [3dcb0fb1]

	* Makefile.in: Removed mostly obsolete hint on AOLServer [1c2a0be9]

	* nsf.c (NsfProcDeleteProc): Fix memcounting by adjusting type
	spec, otherwise leading to a wrong false positive on memcount
	tests [0922b668]

2024-09-27  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* nsf.c (Nsf_Init): Tcl 9 reform: One needs 'Tcl_InitStubs(interp,
	"8.5-",...)' instead of 'Tcl_InitStubs(interp, "8.5",...)', since
	the semantics are seemingly the same as in "package require
	...". [3ba8209e]

	Without this change, we see in the NaviServer regression test the
	following error message:

	    version conflict for package "tcl": have 9.0.0, need 8.5
	        while executing
	    "load {} Nsf"
	        invoked from within
	    "ns_ictl update"
	        (procedure "ns_cleanup" line 8)
	        invoked from within

2024-07-14  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu.ac.at>

	* win/rules.vc: Tcl 9 reform: Tcl does not add a version infix to
	the stub library name [7fd955bd]

2024-07-11  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu.ac.at>

	* appveyor.yml: Fix appveyor build descriptor [3702c134]

2024-06-26  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* nsf.c, nsf.h: Fix for transitional bug due to NS_TCL_HAVE_TIP629
	Deactivating NS_TCL_HAVE_TIP629, since this needs more work to
	deal with the two different types of commands (before and after
	the TIP) [19220221]

	   * When we activate NS_TCL_HAVE_TIP629 (TIP supporting > 2^31
	   * elements in object vectors), Tcl defines different objProcs
	   * (Tcl_ObjCmdProc and Tcl_ObjCmdProc2) where the usage of these
	   * depends on a cmdWrapperProc. Unfortunately, the resolving of
	   * these are performed via CmdWrapperInfo, which is not exported. We
	   * have to think how to resolve these to make this working as with
	   * prior Tcl versions.

2024-06-19  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	removed debugging output for NS_TCL_HAVE_TIP629
	[6a3286e8]

2024-06-19  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu.ac.at>

	* nsf.h: Remove leftover in header file [6baa11e7]

2024-06-18  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* nsf.c, nsf.h: Tcl 9 reform: Improved cleanness of compilation [083692dd]

2024-05-03  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* nsf.c, nsf.h: Tcl 9 reform: Improved cleanness of compilation [a9ab0550]

2024-02-11  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* rosetta-unknown-method.tcl: Improved spelling [e34b17e5]

	* nx.tcl: Fixed misleading name of variable [285f60aa]

2024-02-11  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* nx.tcl: Fixed handling of invalid parameter specs
	This bug was occurring e.g. with an invalid parameter spec as in

	   :property {fiscalyear:integer, required}

	where an additional space was introduced. The bug was reported by
	Maksym Zinchenko on the xotcl mailing list (many thanks for that!)
	and lead to an attempt of adding an empty parameter option.
	Now, an error is generated in this case. [32fd4c6b]

2024-01-20  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* nsf.c: Improved comment [f2bfddf1]

2024-01-16  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* nsf.c, nx.tcl, Access.xotcl: improved spelling [3234688f]

	* nsf.c, testx.xotcl: Fix potential crash and swallowed error.
	The change fixes 2 bugs:
	- When a non-existing method was called in a situation where
	   * a filter with guards is registered, and
	   * all guards are failing, and
	   * the method to be called after the filter does not exist
	  nsf was crashing
	- There was no code to produce the proper error message in such
	situations [91e563ce]

2023-12-05  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* nsf.c, tests/*.test: Improved spelling [43373d98]

	* langRef.xotcl: Fix typo [c5416441]

	* testo.xotcl: Tcl 9 reform: TIP 673 removed "trace variable",
	which was deprecated since the release of Tcl 8.4. However, since
	Tcl does not warn about deprecations, so it was not detected until
	TIP #673 removed the command for Tcl9. [c2980f95] Whitespace
	changes [5f06502c]

2023-11-30  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* nsf.c: nsf:parseargs: honor "required" settings. The previous
	version was accepting e.g.:

	    nsf::parseargs -asdict {
	      {-state:wordchar,required}
	      {-revision_id:integer,required}
	      {-return_url:localurl "."}
	    } {}

	i.e. passing empty argument list where the first two arguments are required.
	Now, the error is flagged properly [ef60fd6e]

2023-11-17  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* nsf.c, nsfProfile.c: Tcl 9 reform: Provide clean compilation for current Tcl 9
	[7c55d2af]

2023-11-14  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* nsf.h: Tcl 9 reform: reflect type change of Tcl TIP 666 (use
	Tcl_Size for object count in TIP 627) [a24fe86a]

2023-09-09  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* mongoAPI.h, nsfmongo.c (mongo::oid::gettimestamp): New API call
	to obtain creation timestamp from OID [7fd68223]

2023-09-03  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* nx.tcl, accessor.test: Whitespace cleanup [bdae7a1f]

2023-08-23  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu.ac.at>

	* accessor.test: Added tests to document the behaviour for
	internally generated per-slot accessor methods
	* nx.tcl (VariableSlot), properties.test: Make sure that calling
	delete on a single-valued property/ variable errors out, like
	calling add * nx.tcl (defineIncrementalOperations): Rewrite to
	avoid repetitive computations
	* nx.tcl: First take on fixing definition of incremental slot
	operations, in presence of custom provided ones
	(esp. value=delete) [83355de2]

2023-06-12  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu.ac.at>

	* nx.tcl: Make sure to return "switch" for object parameters via
	info-introspection. Added some tests. [65d13b7b]

2023-06-10  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* nsf.c: Provided a Tcl_DupInternalRepProc() function for
	Tcl_ObjType "nsfParam" Recent versions of Tcl9 call
	Tcl_DupInternalRepProc() for Tcl_ObjType "nsfParam", which was a
	placeholder function before, leading to a Tcl_Abort(). The
	provided implementation provides now a basic logic for "duplicating"
	internal representations of parameter lists based on refcounts
	(somewhat similar to ProcBodyDup), but it has to be tested
	further, with a proper test case.

	The call of the Tcl_DupInternalRepProc function happens so far during
	the startup of NaviServer compiled with Tcl9. It might be necessary to
	overthink the competing logics of the "canFree" member and the
	reference count. For now, the intention is to get the NaviServer +
	Tcl9 regression test stop from aborting [d7a71fbd]

2023-04-19  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* nsf.c, nsf.h, nsfInt.h: Cleanup after TIP 660 [6f3bbd8f]

2023-04-18  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu.ac.at>

	* appveyor.yml: Force use of SCP in newer OpenSSH > 9 releases,
	otherwise defaulting to SFTP [cf765c0d]

2023-04-16  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* nsf.c, nsfCmdPtr.c, nsfObj.c: Fixed warnings detected with
	branch "disabletcl8api" The Tcl9 native interface is based on
	"Tcl_Size" instead of "int", but the default mode hides these
	differences via some macro-magic. Typical such cases are API calls
	like:

	   Tcl_ListObjLength(interp, methodObj, &length);
	   Tcl_ListObjGetElements(interp, methodObj, &oc, &ov)

	The macro-magic queries the size of the provided parameters and uses
	the old or new interface depending on it (while hiding some more
	potential problems, a compiler can detect). The branch
	"disabletcl8api" removes the macro-magic and reveals the potential
	problem areas, where the code is still depending on the old 32bit
	interface.

	This commit fixes such cases and the collateral damage. [10f06c20]

2023-04-16  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* nsf.h: Tcl 9 reform: Deactivate support of TIP 629 for the time being When
	NS_TCL_HAVE_TIP629 (TIP supporting > 2^31 elements in object
	vectors) is activated, Tcl defines different objProcs
	(Tcl_ObjCmdProc and Tcl_ObjCmdProc2) for the old and new API,
	where the usage of these depends on a
	cmdWrapperProc. Unfortunately, the resolving of these API calls is
	performed through the wrapper via CmdWrapperInfo, which is not
	exported. We have to think how to resolve these to make this
	working as with prior Tcl versions. [4b2efda0]

	* Makefile.in: Added missing dependency for forcing recompilation
	[818bfb7f]

2023-04-16  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* nsf.c, nsfAPI.h, mongoAPI.h: Tcl 9 reform: Provide support for
	TIP 627 (Tcl 8.7a6+ and Tcl 9) TIP 627 introduces support for >
	2^31 elements in object vectors (e.g., number of words in a single
	Tcl command). For details, see https://core.tcl-lang.org/tips/doc/trunk/tip/627.md

	To provide also backwards compatibility, this change uses the
	macros TCL_COMMAND_OBJPROC, TCL_CREATEOBJCOMMAND,
	TCL_NRCALLOBJPROC, TCL_NRCREATECOMMAND, TCL_OBJCMDPROC_T, and
	TCL_OBJC_T. [745c46b4]

2023-04-15  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* nsf.c: Updated copyright notice [d9d5b503]

2023-03-16  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* Script.xotcl: changed file  encoding to UTF-8 to improve
	robustness in various Tcl9 variants (e.g. TIP 657) [6f1b0bd8]

2023-01-03  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* nx-zip.tcl (returnZipFile): Added optional parameter channel to
	returnZipFile to ease usage in the background Many thanks to
	Antonio Pisano for the suggestion! [7dbbd336]

2022-12-19  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* asmAssembleTemplate.c, nsfAsmAssemble.c, nsf.c, secure-webserver.xotcl, trace.xotcl, tests/*.test: improve spelling [3e1001ff]

2022-12-19  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* nsf.c, nsf-cmd.test, returns.test: Added support
	for return value checker for nsf::proc One can now specify
	"-returns ...." in nsf::proc commands the same way as in nx/XOTcl2
	methods.

	   nsf::proc ... /procName/ /arguments/ ?-returns /valueconstraint/? /body/

	When return value checkers are defined, these are returned by the
	usual introspection interface.

	  % nsf::proc ::foo {-a:integer} -returns integer {return 1}

	  % nsf::cmd::info definition ::foo
	  ::nsf::proc ::foo -a:integer -returns integer {return 1}

	  % nsf::cmd::info returns ::foo
	  integer

	The regression test was extended to cover these cases. [b44ba341]

2022-12-19  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* nx-shell.tcl, nx-zip.tcl, serializer.tcl, doc/*.man: Improved
	spelling [84277b25,da2688b9]

2022-12-17  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* doc/next-tutorial/value-checkers*: Fixed omission of checkers in
	graphic [f308a675]

	* nsfCompile.c, nsfAssemble.c, asmAssembleTemplate.c, nsfAsmAssemble.c, asmAssembleTemplate.c:  Tcl 9 reform (cont'd) [fcfefac7]

	* nsf.c (Nsf_ConvertToTclObjType), returns.test: Fix bug, where
	Tcl's "string is" checker modified result, when used as a return
	value checker. The new code saves and restores the original result
	value.  The regression test was extended.  Many thanks to Antonio
	Pisano for pointing out this issue. [07564105]

2022-11-22  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* nsfInt.h (CHARTYPE): generalize handling of "is <type>" calls by
	defining CHARTTYPE.  The macro was developed earlier on
	NaviServer, and is used in nsf for "upper", "space" and "alpha"
	character checkers [f0bca18a]

	* nsf.c, nsfObj.c (TCL_OBJTYPE_V0): Tcl 9 reform: Provide an
	initializer for the new size_t field of Tcl_ObjType [a2f1d967]

	* nsfCompile.c: Tcl 9 reform: Avoid macro TCL_OUT_LINE_COMPILE (many thanks to Jan Nijtmans) [30e90f77]

2022-09-29  Gustaf Neumann  <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* nx-zip.tcl (flushBuffer): In NaviServer mode, flush buffers
	after every file. This avoid potential interger overruns in Tcl,
	when sending many large files over slow lines. [94dce307]

2022-08-15  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu.ac.at>

	* README.release: Clarify how to produce HTML documentation for
	sourceforge.io [a7fcb6d4]
