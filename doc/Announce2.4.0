Dear Community,

We are pleased to announce the availability of the Next Scripting
Framework (NSF) 2.4.0. The changes are mostly perfective improvements
in terms of bug fixes, API consistency, and backwards
compatibility. See below for the details.

Diff stats since 2.3.0:
  182 files changed, 26811 insertions(+), 20333 deletions(-)

Major changes relative to 2.3.0 are: NSF now compiles and runs with
Tcl 9 (core.tcl-lang.org/tcl main branch at the time of writing,
August 2022). This way, NSF/NX/XOTcl can be used with the Tcl 8.5.*
series, Tcl 8.6.*, and Tcl 8.7.* and Tcl 9.* on Linux/Windows/macOS.
One can see the results of the compilations and test runs on

Selected changes worth mentioning:

- Maintenance & bug fixes:

  * Tcl 9: For the first time, NSF now compiles and its test suite
    completes with Tcl 9. Kudos to Jan Njitmans and Gustaf Neumann.

  * Tcl 8.7:

    o Support for the Tcl 8.7a5 release

      (core.tcl-lang.org/tcl branch "core-8-branch"). NSF compiles and
      its regression tests execute successfully (including
      TCL_NO_DEPRECATE).

    o NSF is now TIP-538 ready (Tcl starting relying on libtommath
      as an extrinsic dependency).

  * Plug a small memory leak when using mp_int (libtommath) data internally.

  * Fix a crash when using volatile combined with configure in XOTcl 2.

  * Fix crashes due to internal cache mismanagement of flag names
    processed by configure/ cget. See
    https://groups.google.com/g/comp.lang.tcl/c/F9cn_Ah4js4/m/eL22xbQaCgAJ

  * Exit from non-threaded NSF builds will not hang anymore.

  * Prefer using Tcl_InterpDeleted() over explicitly checking bit mask
    flags internal to Tcl.

  * Misc (esp. NSF/C): Ran valgrind checks, as well as Facebook's/
    Meta's "infer".

- Build environments, automated builds:

  * Render Makefile more robust in light of file paths containing
    whitespace characters

  * Due to Travis becoming unavailable, we moved to GitHub Actions for
    automated builds on Linux and macOS. Windows builds are still
    served by AppVeyor.

- XOTcl:

  * "dict" is now available as a per-object method, similar to
    "array".

- MongoDB:

  * Tested the NSF MongoDB binding against latest stable releases of
    MongoDB (5.0.9) and MongoDB-C driver (1.22.1).

  * Fixed test case for gridfs and file renaming

- Documentation:

  * Improved wording and corrected spelling in man pages, tutorials,
    and examples.
