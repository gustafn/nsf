Announcing XOTcl 0.9.3
**********************

WHAT IS XOTCL?

  XOTcl is an object-oriented extension of Tcl that was derived from
  OTcl. In short, XOTcl tries to provide a highly flexible,
  reflective, component-based, and object-oriented environment. It
  integrates language support for high-level concepts which are not
  found in other languages, with reasonable performance. It prevails
  the Tcl programming style and the dynamic/introspective nature of
  the language, rather than introducing other language's styles and
  rigidness (such as C++) into Tcl.


RECENT CHANGES relative to 0.9 are:

  - A "more or less" TEA compliant build process and its
    directory structure (aligend it as far as possible to Tcl, sample
    extension and other extensions)

    * We started building an XOTcl stub lib.

    * We separated xotcl from its library/applications 
      (there is an xotcl-<VERSION> directory in the full distribution
       that just builds, installs, etc. the XOTcl libraries ... this
       can for instance be used in other distributions using and
       shipping XOTcl, but not using the shells).

    * The full distribution still builds shells, but they are using
      "package require" to load the XOTcl libraries now.

    * For building xowish (the XOTcl Tk shell) you do only require 
      an installed Tk version on Unix now.

  - On Windows we still use nmake due to problems with VCC 6.0 in
    all TEA compliant extensions we have checked, but we use a
    completely new build process (more or less one-to-one the
    Unix build process).

  - A few minor bugfixes.

  - We have tested this release on platforms we have access to
    (Linux, Win NT, Solaris). Please inform us, if there are some
    problems on your platform so that we can eliminate them in future
    releases.
