Announcing XOTcl 1.0.2
**********************

WHAT IS XOTCL?

  XOTcl is an object-oriented extension of Tcl that was derived from
  OTcl. In short, XOTcl tries to provide a highly flexible,
  reflective, component-based, and object-oriented environment. It
  integrates language support for high-level concepts which are not
  found in other languages, with reasonable performance. It prevails
  the Tcl programming style and the dynamic/introspective nature of
  the language, rather than introducing other language's styles and
  rigidness (such as C++) into Tcl.


CHANGES relative to 1.0.1 are:

  - fixes:
 
     * fixes for copying/moving objects to same name

     * works out of the box with AOL-server 4.0
       (no patch for AOL-server needed)

     * various small fixes and code cleanup

     * new directory structure (no nested version numbers)

     * improved object and class serializer 

  - new functionality and improvements:

     * new method "ismixin": Test whether the argument is a 
       mixin or instmixin of the object.

     * new method "hasclass": Test whether the argument is either 
       a mixin or instmixin of the object or if it is on the class
       hierarchy of the object.  This method combines the
       functionalities of istype and ismixin.

     * arguments of configure methods can start now
       with a leading "-" without ambiguity. In previous versions

         Class C -parameter {name counter}
         C c1 -name -x -counter 123

       the configuration of c1 was interpreted as follows

          method argc 
          name    0
          x       0 
          counter 1

       Starting with XOTcl 1.0.2 arguments can be protected
       by putting it into a list:

         C c1 [list -name -x] -counter 123

       which is interpreted as follows:

          method argc 
          name    1
          counter 1

 For more details, please consult the ChangeLog
