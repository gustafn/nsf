Announcing XOTcl 1.3.3
**********************

WHAT IS XOTCL?

  XOTcl is an object-oriented extension of Tcl that was derived from
  OTcl. In short, XOTcl tries to provide a highly flexible,
  reflective, component-based, and object-oriented environment. It
  integrates language support for high-level concepts which are not
  found in other languages, with reasonable performance. It prevails
  the Tcl programming style and the dynamic/introspective nature of
  the language, rather than introducing other language's styles and
  rigidness (such as C++) into Tcl.


Major changes relative to 1.3.1 are:

  - Qualitative Improvements

     * Improved code quality: 
       + fixed possible segmentation violations in free memory reads
         (many thanks to Zoran Vasiljevic for his help with purify)
       + fixed "self callinglevel" when uplevel was called from uplevel
       + fixed nonposargs
       + fixed configure in connection with enable-symbols and 
         for AOLserver configuration
       + extended regression test

     * Improved Functionality
       + Producing error message when a non-existing proc/instproc
         is tried to be deleted
       + fixed exists method for objects with namespaces by using
         a namespace resolver
       + fixed return code for unknown handling in next
       + reduced memory consumption for objects and classes with procs/instprocs
         of about 14%

     * Improved Documentation
