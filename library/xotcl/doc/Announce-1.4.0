Announcing XOTcl 1.4.0
*************************

Hi everybody. I am pleased to announce the availability of XOTcl 1.4.0.
Major changes relative to 1.3.9 are:

    * Improved Functionality
      * new option: ::xotcl::configure softrecreate on|off
         if softrecreate is set, class relations (superclass, subclass, class, instances)
         are not affected by a recreate; this allows files with class definitions
	 more easily to reload
       + easier syntax for providing commands for initializing default values
       + setting and querying options for ::xotcl::configure similar to set

     * Improved code quality: 
       + fixed a bug in connection with nonpositional arguments and "args"
       + fixed a bug with adding on the fly transitive mixin classes
       + fixed a bug with filter states after next
       + fixed omitted error message after calling self with unknown subcommands
       + fixed a bug with variable traces on thread exit (triggered by volatile)
       + fixed incorrect rpm dependencies
       + cleaner compile for xotcl for gcc 4.* under linux
       + don't destroy namespace imported child objects
       + info children returns true children, not namespace imported objects/classes
       + unsetting the global variable "cmd" from predefined.xotcl
       + Upgraded TEA to 3.5
       + more regression tests addeed

 For more details about the changes, please consult the ChangeLog and
 documentation.
