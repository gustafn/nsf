Announcing XOTcl 1.0
********************

WHAT IS XOTCL?

  XOTcl is an object-oriented extension of Tcl that was derived from
  OTcl. In short, XOTcl tries to provide a highly flexible,
  reflective, component-based, and object-oriented environment. It
  integrates language support for high-level concepts which are not
  found in other languages, with reasonable performance. It prevails
  the Tcl programming style and the dynamic/introspective nature of
  the language, rather than introducing other language's styles and
  rigidness (such as C++) into Tcl.


CHANGES relative to 0.9.4 are:

  - fixes:
 
     * various small fixes for compilation with tcl8.4.*

     * fixed some more memory-leaks that showed up in connection
       with multi-threading (many thanks to Zoran Vasiljevic for 
       his great help)

     * removed a few panics() by tcl errors (important for servers)

     * various small fixes in Httpd-code

     * fixes in filter-search mechanism

     * the general cleanup method __exitHandler (called on
       interpreter exits and on thread exits) defined now
       as a proc of Object

  - optimizations:

     * speedup during recreation of objects
